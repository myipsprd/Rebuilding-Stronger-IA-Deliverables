				<div class="et_pb_tab_content">Many colleges and universities require college entrance examinations (SAT and ACT) in the admissions process.  Students should take practice tests, including the PSAT, and sign up to take the tests early in their junior year in order to allow ample time to retest.<br />
PSAT/NMSQT (Preliminary Scholastic Assessment Test/National Merit Scholarship Qualifying Test)<br />
The Preliminary Scholastic Assessment Test/National Merit Scholarship Qualifying Test (PSAT/NMSQT) (more often simply called the PSAT) is nationally administered by the College Entrance Examination Board (CEEB), and assesses students in three areas: Verbal, Mathematics, and Writing.<br />
The PSAT is used to help students practice for the Scholastic Assessment Test (SAT) and to qualify for scholarships and recognition from such programs as: National Merit Scholarships, National Achievement Scholarships for Outstanding African American Students, National Hispanic Scholar Recognition Program, Student Search Service, and some statewide and national industry scholarship competitions. Registration information will be available in the school counselor’s office at each high school.<br />
SAT (Scholastic Assessment Test)<br />
The SAT is an optional test nationally administered by the College Board. It assesses students in the following areas: Evidence-Based Reading and Writing, Math and an optional Essay.<br />
The redesigned SAT focuses on knowledge, skills, and understandings that research has identified as most important for college and career readiness and success. There is a greater emphasis on the meaning of words in extended contexts and on how word choice shapes meaning, tone, and impact. The SAT is one of the admissions tests used by post-secondary institutions to assist in selecting students.<br />
The SAT is administered at selected sites nationally. Students must pay and register online or by mail several weeks prior to the test date. Registration information is available in the school counselors’ office at each high school and at www.collegeboard.org.<br />

The ACT assesses high school students’ general educational development and their ability to complete college-level work. The ACT has five sub scores: four multiple-choice tests covering skill areas of English, Mathematics, reading, and science; the Writing Test measuring skill in planning and writing a short essay.<br />
The ACT is also administered at selected sites nationally. For these administrations, students must pay and register online or by mail several weeks prior to the test date. Registration information is available in the school counselor’s office at each high school. More information is available at www.actstudent.org.<br />
College Entrance Exam Tips<br />
Sign up to take the SAT (https://www.collegeboard.org/) and ACT (http://www.act.org/) for the first time as a sophomore or junior.  Taking these tests early will allow you plenty of time to learn from your first testing experience, practice, and retest if needed before college applications are due your senior year.<br />
Study a little each evening instead of cramming the night before testing. Learning works best when done over time so that you can retain the information long term instead of just memorizing overnight.<br />
Get a good night’s rest the night before testing.  Your brain will work best after 8-10 hours of sleep so be sure to go to bed early so that you can do your best on test day.<br />
Eat a nutritious breakfast on test day.  Remember that food is your body’s fuel and just like you would fill up your gas tank before a long road trip; your body needs fuel to do its best.<br />
Use your resources to practice each day!  Studying for college entrance tests like the ACT and SAT has never been more convenient.  Use your smartphone, tablet, or computer to practice daily with SAT and ACT question of the day.<br />
When studying for the SAT and ACT, take at least one full-length practice test.  Taking a full test will help you better manage your time and will give you the best idea of what it will be like on test day.  If you can, gather some friends and have a teacher or parent proctor your full practice test for the best practice!<br />
Take the PSAT and then use personalized test prep!   In the fall, all IPS sophomores and juniors take the PSAT and can use their results to set-up a test prep plan by linking their College Board account to Khan Academy https://signup.collegeboard.org/official-sat-practice/. IPS students can also access free, personalized SAT test prep in their Naviance Family Connection account!</div>

				<div class="et_pb_tab_content">Students in Indianapolis Public Schools must complete the state mandated graduation requirements in order to be awarded a high school diploma. In 8th grade, all IPS students will complete a four-year plan where they will work with a school counselor to determine the diploma path that is best for their individual strengths and postsecondary plans. Details on each state approved diploma type as well as the certificate of completion are included below.<br />
Core 40 and Honors Diploma Requirements<br />
The Core 40 diploma is the required diploma track for all students in Indiana. Legislation also made Core 40 a minimum college admission requirement for the state’s public four-year universities beginning in the fall of 2011.<br />
Students can earn the Core 40 with Academic and/or Technical Honors by completing additional requirements, including maintaining a “B” GPA and taking advanced coursework.<br />
General Diploma Requirements<br />
Students must have a formal opt-out conference with their parents/guardians and school staff in order to graduate with a general diploma. At the conference, parents must determine whether or not their students could receive a greater benefit from the General Diploma.<br />
Certificate of Completion Information<br />
Students who are taken off the diploma path by a Case Conference Committee will pursue a Certificate of Completion. Students who enter high school in 2018-19 (Class of 2022) and beyond will have revised requirements for their Certificate of Completion.<br />
Early Graduation Requirements<br />
Indiana has a provision for a student to earn a high school diploma in seven semesters instead of eight, assuming the following steps have been taken:</p>
<p>The student has met all graduation requirements;<br />
The student has been accepted and enrolled into a post secondary educational institution; or<br />
The student has an enlistment contract with a branch of the U.S. armed forces that contains an educational component.</p>
<p>Requests will be initiated by students at the beginning of their 7th semester, approved in writing by the parent/guardian, and presented to the school counselor and to the principal. Students meeting the seven-semester graduation requirement may participate in commencement exercises at the discretion of the principal.<br />

				<div class="et_pb_tab_content">Students and families can and should begin planning and preparing for college well before high school! Use this year-by-year guide as a resource to ensure that you (or your student) are ready for the 3Es (Enrollment, Enlistment or Employment) upon graduation.<br />
7th-8th Grade<br />
Submit an application for Indiana’s 21st Century Scholars Program by June 30 of your 8th-grade year. The 21st Century Scholars Program can pay up to full tuition at an Indiana college or university for eligible students!<br />
Come to school and do your best daily! Subjects you take in middle school prepare you for your high school classes, so take school seriously and learn all that you can in order to be successful in high school.<br />
9th-10th Grade<br />
Start early! Begin researching scholarships your freshman year of high school using online scholarship search tools such as:<br />
https://www.fastweb.com/<br />
https://bigfuture.collegeboard.org/scholarship-search<br />
Apply for scholarships for 9th- and 10th-grader students and keep a file for 11th- and 12th-grade scholarships. By the time you are a senior, you will know exactly which scholarships to apply for, saving you a lot of time!<br />
Work hard in your classes. Many scholarships have GPA requirements and 9th grade is when you start to build your GPA. Start with good habits and As your freshman year so it will be easier for you to meet GPA requirements later in high school.<br />
Take the PSAT as a 10th grader and use your scores to practice for the SAT. After receiving your score report, link your account to the Khan Academy for individualized SAT practice based on your strengths and weaknesses. https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/pdf/steps-linking-college-board-khan-academy-accounts.pdf<br />
Find your passion and get involved. Whether it is athletics, drama, community service or another extracurricular, be sure to become active in your school and community. These experiences will not only help make your resume look great, but they can also help you meet friends and have fun! <br />
11th Grade<br />
Show your leadership skills. Consider running for a leadership position in your extracurricular or even starting your own club/student group. As an upperclassman, you can share what you have learned with younger students and start to make your mark on your school.<br />
Take challenging classes. College and scholarship programs review seniors&#8217; transcripts and look for students who do well in rigorous classes. Think about your academic strengths and talk with your counselor about taking an honors, AP or dual-credit course.<br />
Do your research. There are thousands of colleges with as many degree and certification options. Use the SuperMatch College Search in your Naviance Family Connection account to help narrow down your choices.<br />
Take the SAT and ACT tests for the first time. Taking your college entrance exams as a junior allows you plenty of time to study, become comfortable with the test format, and improve your scores.<br />
Explore both public and private colleges. Don’t be scared off by the sticker price of a private college because many have very generous scholarship and financial-aid packages. Use tools like the Indiana College Cost Estimator http://www.indianacollegecosts.org/ and FAFSA4Caster https://fafsa.ed.gov/FAFSA/app/f4cForm?execution=e2s1 to compare costs before you apply.<br />
12th Grade<br />
Use your summer wisely. Spend your summer building your resume, getting a head start on college essays, and thinking about who is the best person to write you a recommendation letter. If you plan ahead and get organized, application season will go smoothly so you won’t miss deadlines.<br />
Ask teachers, counselors, coaches or other school staff to write letters of recommendation and give them at least two weeks to complete. School staff typically write letters for multiple students and any less time will mean that your letter may not be as detailed and personal as it could be with proper planning. These letters make a big difference to scholarship and college professionals so plan ahead of deadlines and make sure to ask someone who knows you well!<br />
Share your scholarship and college essay drafts with teachers, counselors, parents and friends to receive feedback. Make revisions based on their notes so that you are turning in your very best work.<br />
Apply early! Many colleges have early deadlines for admissions that can increase your chances for getting in and qualifying for their scholarships. Pay attention to these deadlines and be ready to submit your application at least a few days ahead in case you run into any last-minute problems.<br />
File your FAFSA! The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) opens October 1 and Indiana’s filing deadline is April 15. The FAFSA is completed online at https://fafsa.gov/ and is required to be eligible for many scholarships and grants including the 21st Century Scholarship, Federal Pell Grants and federal student loans. Talk with your school counselor about Indiana College Goal Sunday or other financial-aid/FAFSA help nights at your school to get free assistance.</div>

<p>IPS is proud to offer Career and Technical Education (CTE) pathways in several of our high schools.&nbsp; Through an extensive redesign of programs, students can now choose their high school based on their interest and the programs offered at a particular school, instead of being locked into attending a high school based on where they live within the district.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Through the redesign, our high schools have incorporated specific College and Career Academies, which include a defined sequence of courses, leading to an industry recognized certification, dual credit and/or opportunities for students to participate in work-based learning experiences throughout Grades 9-12.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These experiences are being supported by surrounding businesses and industries within the community. The partnerships are vital components and assist IPS in providing dynamic, high quality CTE programs to students.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Career and Technical Education (CTE)</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Career Technical Education (CTE) provides learners with the knowledge and skills they need to be prepared for college and careers. CTE gives purpose to learning by emphasizing real-world skills and practical knowledge within a selected career focus.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Students in CTE programs take specialized courses in addition to required courses, and often have the opportunity to participate in internships, engage with mentors and practice what they are learning through hands-on projects. Students can participate in CTE at the middle or high school level and at postsecondary institutions in all communities and in all states across the U.S.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For more information about CTE programs in IPS, please contact CTE Pathway Director, Jenny Berry (<a href="mailto:berryjennifer@myips.org">berryjennifer@myips.org</a>).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Work Based Learning (WBL)</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>IPS’ work-based learning continuum provides a framework of expectations for student experiences from Grades 8-12.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>IPS staff at the district and school levels are working to steward partnerships with employers, institutions of higher education and mission-aligned community-based organizations to provide students with meaningful postsecondary-oriented learning along the continuum.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The continuum progresses from less intensive exploratory experiences to the ultimate goal of providing students with paid employment or dual-enrollment during Grade 11 and/or Grade 12.</p>

					One of the best strategies for examining and understanding how to reach and teach a diverse student population is to become literate about who they are, where they come from and the gifts they bring with them.<br />

<p>We offer the IPS community an annual update
summarizing from the previous school year not only Title IX activity, but also
CPS (Child Protective Services) report activity, as the two are often closely
related. It includes our efforts in prevention and education from the previous
school year, as well as our goals as we enter this new school year. We hope it
provides stakeholders a clearer understanding of student and staff experiences
and the scope of support needed from all members of the IPS community to care
for our students.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>7th-8th Grade</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Submit an application for Indiana’s 21st Century Scholars Program at <a href="http://scholars.in.gov/">http://scholars.in.gov/</a> by June 30th of your 8th grade year.&nbsp;The 21st Century Scholars Program can pay up to full tuition at an Indiana college or university for eligible students!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Come to school and do your best daily!&nbsp;Subjects you take in middle school prepare you for your high school classes, so take school seriously and learn all that you can so that you can do well as a freshman.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>9th-10th Grade</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Start early!&nbsp;Begin researching scholarships your freshman year of high school using online scholarship search tools such as <a href="https://www.fastweb.com/">https://www.fastweb.com/</a> or <a href="https://bigfuture.collegeboard.org/scholarship-search">https://bigfuture.collegeboard.org/scholarship-search</a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Apply for scholarships for 9th and 10th grade students and keep a file for 11th and 12th grade scholarships.&nbsp;By the time you are a senior, you will know exactly what scholarships to apply for saving you a lot of time!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Work hard in your classes. Many scholarships have grade point average (GPA) requirements and 9th grade is when you start to build your GPA. Starting off with good habits and A’s your freshman year will make it easier for you to meet GPA requirements later in high school.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Find your passion and get involved.&nbsp;Whether it is athletics, drama, community service or another extracurricular, be sure to become active in your school and community. These experiences will not only help make your resume look great, but they can also help you meet friends and have fun!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>11th Grade</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Show your leadership skills.&nbsp;Consider running for a leadership position in your extracurricular or even starting your own club/student group.&nbsp;As an upperclassman, you can share what you have learned with younger students and start to make your mark on your school.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Take challenging classes. College and scholarship programs review your transcript as a senior and look for students who do well in rigorous classes.&nbsp;Think about your academic strengths and talk with your counselor about taking an honors, AP or dual credit course.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Do your research.&nbsp;There are thousands of colleges with many degree and certification options. Use the <em>SuperMatch College Search</em> in your Naviance Student account to help narrow down your choices.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Explore both public and private colleges. Don’t be scared off by the sticker price of a private college because many have very generous scholarship and financial aid packages. Use tools like the <a href="https://fafsa.ed.gov/spa/fafsa4c/?locale=en_US#/landing">FAFSA4Caster </a>to compare costs before you apply.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>12th Grade</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Use your summer wisely. Spend your summer building your resume, getting a head start on college essays and thinking about who is the best person to write you a recommendation letter. If you plan ahead and get organized, application season will go smoothly so you won’t miss deadlines.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ask teachers, counselors, coaches or other school staff to write letters of recommendation and give them at least two weeks to complete.&nbsp;School staff typically write letters for multiple students and any less time will mean that your letter may not be as detailed and personal as it could be with proper planning. These letters make a big difference to scholarship and college professionals so plan ahead of deadlines and make sure to ask someone who knows you well!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Share your draft scholarship and college essays with teachers, counselors, parents and friends to receive feedback.&nbsp;Make revisions based on their notes so that you are turning in your very best work.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Apply early!&nbsp;Many colleges have early deadlines for admissions that can increase your chances for getting in and qualifying for their scholarships. Pay attention to these deadlines and be ready to submit your application at least a few days ahead in case you run into any last minute technical problems.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>File your FAFSA!&nbsp;The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) opens October 1st and Indiana’s filing deadline is April 15th. The FAFSA is completed online at <a href="https://fafsa.gov/">https://fafsa.gov/</a> and is required to be eligible for many scholarships and grants including 21st Century Scholarship, Federal Pell Grants and Federal Student Loans.&nbsp;Talk with your school counselor about College Goal Sunday or other Financial Aid/FAFSA Help Nights at your school to get free help.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Many colleges and universities require college entrance examinations (SAT and ACT) in the admissions process.&nbsp; Students should take practice tests, including the PSAT, and sign up to take the tests early in their junior year in order to allow ample time to retest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>PRELIMINARY SCHOLASTIC ASSESSMENT TEST/ NATIONAL MERIT SCHOLARSHIP QUALIFYING TEST (PSAT)&nbsp;</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Preliminary Scholastic Assessment Test/National Merit Scholarship Qualifying Test (PSAT/NMSQT) (more often simply called the PSAT) is nationally administered by the College Entrance Examination Board (CEEB), and assesses students in three areas: Verbal, Mathematics and Writing.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The PSAT is used to help students practice for the Scholastic Assessment Test (SAT) and to qualify for scholarships and recognition from such programs as: National Merit Scholarships, National Achievement Scholarships for Outstanding African American Students, National Hispanic Scholar Recognition Program, Student Search Service, and some statewide and national industry scholarship competitions. Registration information will be available in the school counselor’s office at each high school.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>SAT&nbsp;</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The SAT is a test nationally administered by the College Board. It assesses students in the following areas: Evidence-Based Reading and Writing, Math and an optional Essay.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The redesigned SAT focuses on knowledge, skills and understandings that research has identified as most important for college and career readiness and success. There is a greater emphasis on the meaning of words in extended contexts and on how word choice shapes meaning, tone and impact. The SAT is one of the admissions tests used by post-secondary institutions to assist in selecting students and <strong>is being offered during the school day in many IPS high schools</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The SAT is also administered on Saturdays at selected sites nationally. Students must pay (or use a fee-waiver if they are eligible) and register online or by mail several weeks prior to the test date. Registration and fee waiver information is available in the school counselors’ office and Future Center at each high school and at <a href="http://www.collegeboard.org">www.collegeboard.org</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>ACT&nbsp;</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The ACT assesses high school students’ general educational development and their ability to complete college-level work. The ACT has five sub scores: four multiple-choice tests covering skill areas of English, Mathematics, reading and science; the Writing Test measuring skill in planning and writing a short essay.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The ACT is also administered at selected sites nationally. For these administrations, students must pay (or use a fee-waiver if they are eligible) and register online or by mail several weeks prior to the test date. Registration information is available in the school counselor’s office and Future Center at each high school. More information is available at <a href="http://www.actstudent.org">www.actstudent.org</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-color" style="color:#231f20;font-size:16px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400">At Crispus Attucks, we create an academic culture that links our academies in healthcare and computer science with our focus on creating a sense of belonging and community for all our students. Our personal approach to teaching and learning is grounded in the Crispus Attucks Way and ensures all our students are known, heard and supported from the day they choose Attucks to when they earn their diploma.<br><br>Through our academic programs, Attucks students have the opportunity to pursue the Indiana College Core, earn college dual credit, or take classes at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis. In our Health Sciences Academy, students can explore academic pathways across biomedical sciences, or prepare for college and careers in healthcare. Attucks’ newest Academy, launching in 2022-23, will prepare students for science, technology, engineering and math (STEM)-related college majors and careers. And regardless of our students’ chosen pathway, they have access to a close-knit community marked by 17 varsity sports, XX student organizations and some of the city’s most passionate teachers.</p>

With less than 300 students in each graduating class, we foster a deeply personal and supportive environment that embraces the cultural diversity of our students and the City of Indianapolis.<br><br>At Shortridge, we educate our students to think freely and equip them with all the critical tools and skills they need both inside the classroom and beyond our school walls. Our IB Career program creates a career-related pathway with in-depth study and real-world experience, while our IB Diploma program provides a robust college preparatory focus with coursework across multiple subject areas. All students study a foreign language and complete a capstone project or research paper, in addition to core coursework in the sciences, mathematics, social sciences and the arts. As a result of our students’ deep commitment to service, they must complete an average of 75 hours of community service to graduate.<br><br>We also boast more than 350 student athletes across 20 varsity teams, and 22 student performance groups ranging from choir, dance, orchestra, band and theater.</p>

<h2>Referendum Information</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Indianapolis voters overwhelmingly approved the IPS tax referenda on the November 6, 2018 general election ballot.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These referenda are necessary to fund competitive employee compensation, provide services to the high proportion of special needs students, make safety improvements in classrooms and continue providing the high levels of education our students deserve.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Operating Referendum</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Funds from the operating referendum will support competitive teacher compensation, close funding gaps and provide appropriate levels of service to its high proportion of students with special needs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Capital Referendum</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The capital improvement referendum will generate up to $52M to fund the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.boarddocs.com/in/indps/Board.nsf/files/AZF2V96CF8CB/$file/Capital%20Referendum%20Preliminary%20Determination%20Public%20Hearing%20-%20June%204th%2C%202018.pdf">IPS Safety and Modernization Project</a>&nbsp;which will&nbsp; provide all IPS-owned school buildings with safety and security enhancements including the following:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Enhanced exterior lighting</li><li>Technology upgrades</li><li>Hardened exteriors</li><li>Classroom safety upgrades</li><li>Upgraded emergency communication system</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The $52M capital referendum proposes a local property levy of no more than $0.0332 on each $100 of assessed valuation. The estimated taxpayer impact on a home with a market value of $123,500 would be $1.33 per month. The capital referendum taxes only applies to property owners within the IPS district.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>IPS Deferred Maintenance Breakdown</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>IPS has diligently disposed of several of our unused properties, generated cash to supplement current budgets, and reduced the cost of utilities and deferred maintenance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Several years ago, IPS enlisted the help of IPS maintenance employees and the firm of Shiel Sexton to develop a list of district-wide building needs and their associated costs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Details include:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>District-owned buildings that have been sold, are in the process of being sold, or will close at the end of the 2017-18 school year.</li><li>Takeover schools where the district is still providing daily maintenance but has no intention of investing maintenance dollars.</li><li>The district does not intend to continue to use Thomas Carr Howe and Emmerich Manual High Schools for educational purposes after the current charter operators contract ends. The total associated costs the district will avoid paying is $199,438,218.</li><li>Deferred maintenance in currently occupied schools that&nbsp;<strong>is not</strong>&nbsp;included in the proposed referendum.</li><li>The current long range plan and the referendum status of projects from 2014 through 2020 that still need to be completed.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<p>If it’s taught in the Indianapolis Public Schools district, whether to students or employees, then Teaching and Learning had a hand in planning it. We help plan how ELA, Math, Science, Social Studies, World Languages, ESL and Pre-K courses are taught and how instruction is made available. We’re also deeply involved in our employees’ professional development, including preparing, training and recruiting of high quality teachers and principals. Our students and employees can turn to us with all their instructional needs, and we are happy to serve them.</p>

But we’re also deeply involved in our employees’ professional development. We conduct new teacher induction coaching.

Online Learning provides learning opportunities for all students through an online platform. IPS students can accelerate their learning through online courses. These classes can be completed independently of their traditional class setting or in a computer-based lab during their school day. Students who participate in Online Learning have the support of licensed teachers who instruct, monitor and grade student work and achievement. Online Learning is designed for students who are highly motivated and looking to advance their academic career or recover credits.</div>

				<div class="et_pb_tab_content">One of the most important aspects of supporting online students is to help them stay on pace with the course and monitor their progress. These are instructions on how to monitor your student’s progress.</p>
<p>Log in to your student’s account:Website: PLE.PLATOWEB.COMAccount: Student can crovidePassword: Student can provide<br />
The student home page will look like this image. Where it says “Current Grade” it will also say “Course Grade.”</p>
<p>Current Grade is the grade your student has earned on the work the student has completed with a score of 80% or better.<br />
Course Grade is the grade your student would have in the course if the student stopped working right now. This is the grade that will be on the student transcript.<br />
The Progress Bar is color coded to let you know if your student is on pace. Green is on pace and red is behind pace.<br />
There is a marker on the bar that shows where the student&#8217;s progress should be.</p>
<p>In class, students can retake mastery tests and unit tests to improve their score. They cannot retake end-of-semester tests.<br />
The goal for all students should be to earn an 80 percent or higher on all activities and complete all assignments.</div>

				<div class="et_pb_tab_content">How do I use the program?<br />
When you log in the first time, it will prompt you to watch an orientation video. This should answer most of your questions. If you have questions after watching the video, please ask the lab specialist at your school or message your online teacher through the PLATO messaging system. Online teachers visit buildings on a weekly basis. If your content area instructor does not visit your school, he/she will arrange to meet with you via the PLATO messaging system.<br />
How long do I have to complete the course?<br />
You have one semester to complete your PLATO course(s). You will be given a deadline date by your counselor. The spring 2018 deadline date is June 6, 2018. If you complete a PLATO course before the deadline date, you may begin a new PLATO course by scheduling an appointment with your school counselor. Your counselor will help you decide if there is time to complete another course. All PLATO courses must be completed by the end of the semester. There is an extension request process for documented cases of hospitalization, death in the family, or social-emotional trauma. Counselors have the extension request forms.<br />
What do I do if I need help?<br />
If you are taking your course in a lab at your school, you can speak with the lab specialist. If you are taking your class either during the day at school OR after school, send your online teacher a message through the PLATO messaging system.<br />

				<div class="et_pb_tab_content">Be respectful. While it is easier to say hurtful or disrespectful things without standing face-to-face with someone, it is important to remember that your classmates and teachers are real people who are affected by the words you say and write.  It is essential to keep in mind the feelings and opinions of others, even if they differ from your own. If you wouldn’t say it to someone’s face, don’t say it online either.<br />
Be aware of strong language, all caps and exclamation points. It is easy for written text to be misread and misunderstood.  Have you ever sent a text message with good intent but your recipient thought you were being rude? If so, then you’ve experienced this firsthand.  By being cognizant of strong language, you can identify potential confusions before sending messages. Tip: Read everything out loud before you send it.<br />
Be careful with humor and sarcasm. Certainly you shouldn’t avoid being funny. We love to see your personality shine through in online classes.  Many of our teachers are exceptionally funny too. But like mentioned in Rule No. 2, make sure that it is clear you are being funny and not being rude. Emoticons and smileys can be helpful when conveying humor or sarcasm so that it is read correctly. Just remember to keep the smiley faces away from academic papers<br />
Yes, grammar and spelling matter. While texting, text speak can b gr8 4 ur friends. In an educational setting (even online) however, keep it formal.  Your written communication should be professional and reflect proper writing style. Save written shortcuts and less than stellar grammar for Snapchat if you must, but follow grammar rules for school.<br />
Cite your sources. Whenever you are sharing an idea that originated from someone else (even if it is not word-for-word), it is good practice to cite that source. This applies to discussion forums too. If you read a great thought in your text, share it, but be sure you let your audience know where you saw it first.<br />
Don’t post or share (even privately) inappropriate material. Enough said there. Nothing is truly private online.<br />
Be forgiving. Remember that not everyone will know these rules before posting. Try to be understanding of others when they struggle with written communication. It is very different than simply talking to a person face-to-face.</div>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Title I is a federally-funded program that provides supplemental educational service for eligible public and non-public school students. Services are designed to help students acquire the knowledge and skills necessary to meet academic performance standards of the IPS district and state. These services help provide support to Title I schools in an efficient, effective and timely manner in order to enable schools to address the needs of their students and staff.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Targeted Assistance School</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The term “Targeted Assistance” signifies that the services are provided to a select group of students who have been identified as failing, or most at risk of failing to meet the State’s challenging content and student performance standards. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Schoolwide School</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> A schoolwide program permits a school to use funds from Title I to upgrade the entire educational program of the school in order to raise academic achievement for all the students. A school can become a Schoolwide School only after completing a comprehensive planning process.&nbsp; </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Becoming a Title I School</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>You need to complete an Indiana State Department of Education (IDOE) application and submit it to the Title I Office for review and submission to the state.</li><li>IDOE selects the schools to participate in the year long planning process.</li><li>The principal and selected teachers will be required to participate in planning workshops throughout the school year.</li><li>IDOE Title I Office will determine, after the yearlong planning process, if schools qualify to become schoolwide schools.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>No Child Left Behind</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB), signed into law Jan. 8, 2002, regulates elementary and secondary education. This federal law sets three goals:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol><li>Ensure that all students, including minorities, those from low-income families and those with special needs have an equal opportunity.</li><li>Hold schools responsible if all children do not perform at grade level or above.</li><li>Ensure there is a highly qualified teacher in each classroom.</li></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To meet these goals, NCLB follows four guiding principles:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol><li>Increased accountability for results.</li><li>Enhanced flexibility for the way districts spend federal money.</li><li>Expanded options for parents.</li><li>Stronger emphasis on teaching methods that have been proven to work.</li></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>NCLB requires each state and school district to develop and implement standards, assessments and accountability plans for the areas of reading, mathematics, science and attendance. Each state is given the flexibility to define proficiency standards in each of these areas.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Under NLCB, parents may request information from their children’s schools about the professional qualifications of classroom teachers and paraprofessional staff.</p>

<p>Whether preparing financial documents for the Board of School Commissioners, helping schools interpret their budget information, or processing payroll for everyone in IPS, the Finance division offers excellent service with a positive attitude.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For the district, we help ensure the district budget is reconciled and provide information to the School Board and the Superintendent to help guide the overall stewardship and commitment to financial transparency. At a school level, we provide fast access to low-cost, easily ordered supplies through our stocked warehouse and are eager to assist with special orders when we don’t have what a school needs. We address library and textbook needs and process orders and payments for supplies and services. We have contracts in place for schools to purchase items like computers, copiers and furniture. We assist with extracurricular activity payments and travel reimbursement.</p>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner">Student Based Allocation<br />
Student Based Allocation (SBA) is a funding formula that distributes resources to schools according to student needs and characteristics. School leaders then decide how to use those resources to best support their students. As of the 2017-18 school year, IPS uses SBA to develop budgets for all schools.<br />
Goals of SBA:</p>
<p>Equity: Equitably fund each student at each school based on his or her educational needs.<br />
Flexibility: Provide principals more flexibility to make budgetary and academic decisions that meet the needs of their individual school.<br />
Transparency: Clearly show exactly how much funding each school receives and why.</p>
<p>SBA is about spending limited dollars wisely<br />
The shift to SBA allows IPS to more efficiently direct resources to where students need them most; but it does not replace the need to make tough decisions about the way money is spent. SBA allows IPS to focus on investing in programs that work, protect the progress made, and put the interests of students first in every decision.<br />

<p>Referrals for special education services can be obtained by licensed personnel or the parents/guardians. When a referral is initiated, it is presented to the multidisciplinary team at the school where the student attends to review all academic and behavioral data, interview staff, ask questions of parents and seek information that will assist the team in making a decision as to whether to proceed with an evaluation or not.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If the multidisciplinary team determines the referral is appropriate to proceed for an evaluation for special education services, then consent from the parent or guardian will be obtained. Specific evaluation procedures are adhered to as determined by state law and district guidelines.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If the team decides not to evaluate the student, then an appropriate response is made to the referring source. This response will state the reason and if any additional follow-up that will be necessary.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Indianapolis Public Schools is responsible for locating all children ages 3, but less than 22 years of age with a suspected disability who reside within the Indianapolis Public School district.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After receiving a referral for a suspected disability from a parent or school personnel, a team of qualified professionals reviews all available information, including input from the parents and interventions implemented, to determine if a child who is having academic, behavioral, communication or health problems is suspected of having a disability. Within 10 school days of a parent request, the school must provide the parent written notice responding to the request. If the school agrees to evaluate the student, the parent must provide written consent before the evaluation may begin. Once consent is received by school personnel, the school will evaluate the child within 50 school days, at no cost to the parent.</p>

<p>In the 2021-2022 school year, IPS utilized SPIRE, Sounds Sensible, Heggerty, AMIRA and the Orton-Gillingham Approach to support students who were at risk for dyslexia. 1,720 students were flagged with characteristics of dyslexia using AMIRA as our universal screener. Of those flagged at risk for dyslexia,  97 students qualified for special education services under the category of specific learning disabilities.

If the multidisciplinary team determines the referral is appropriate to proceed for an evaluation for special education services, then consent from the parent or guardian will be obtained. Specific evaluation procedures are adhered to as determined by state law and district guidelines.<br />
If the team decides not to evaluate the student, then an appropriate response is made to the referring source. This response will state the reason and if any additional follow-up that will be necessary.<br />

<p>At Indianapolis Public Schools, there are a variety of ways in which students get to and from school: walking, riding an IPS yellow bus or using IndyGo. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Information about all three transportation options — and who is eligible — can be found below. <strong>A student’s home address is what determines a student’s school boundary. If families choose a school outside of that school’s student boundary, they will be responsible for providing their own transportation.</strong></p>

<ul><li>Transportation is determined by your home address. Families will be notified before the beginning of the 2022-23 school year of their transportation designation.</li><li>Your child can be picked up at their childcare address if: a) your childcare address is within the same boundary as your home address; and b) your childcare address is within distance guidelines for transportation service.</li><li>It is very important that students only use authorized bus stops. Bus drivers are not authorized to assign or change bus stops. Bus stop change requests should be directed to Transportation at 317-226-4000.</li><li>Drivers are instructed to deliver the students to the same bus stop where they boarded the bus. Buses are only to stop at the authorized stops on designated routes.</li><li>For those eligible, all bus stops shall be within .3 mile of a student’s home for elementary and middle school students and .7 mile for high school students.</li></ul>

<h2>Who are considered IndyGo bus riders?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>IPS has selected students in Grades 9–12 at the district high schools to ride IndyGo.</li><li>Selected students will use IndyGo as their sole means of transportation to and from school.</li><li>Students that are assigned to ride – or opt into – IndyGo will receive an IndyGo MyKey transit pass that allows them to ride the entire IndyGo fixed-route network FREE of charge.</li><li>Eligibility criteria for students affected by the transition include:<ul><li>Zero IndyGo bus transfers</li><li>Less than .7-mile total walk</li><li>No more than 50 minutes total travel time. (We anticipate that the average total travel time for eligible students will be 25 minutes.)</li></ul></li><li>Students selected for IndyGo will not receive IPS yellow bus service. Students not selected for IndyGo will receive IPS yellow bus service (but will <strong>not</strong> receive a free IndyGo bus pass).  </li><li>Using IndyGo provides IPS high school students the added benefit of greater mobility to navigate throughout the city while gaining new skills and independence as they move toward their postsecondary plans.</li><li>This includes using their IndyGo MyKey transit pass cards to commute to and from school, work and extracurricular activities, or simply to explore the city’s offerings and attractions.</li></ul>

<p>Modified meals may be requested for students with food allergies, intolerances or other medically-necessary dietary needs such as texture modifications related to swallowing or chewing difficulties.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In order to best serve our students with specialized dietary needs, an Annual Modified Meal Request Form must be completed each school year. The completed Annual Modified Meal Request form will not be carried over from year to year. The parent or guardian is required to submit a new form signed by the student’s physician or medical authority. Recognized medical authorities include physicians, physician assistants, or nurse practitioners. Completed forms should be faxed to 317-226-4677 and will be processed in the order in which they are received. Once processed, the IPS Foodservice Dietitian will contact the parent or guardian with the details of the student’s accommodations, as well as the date those accommodations will begin.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Modified meals cannot be provided to accommodate religious preferences, personal diet modifications or food dislikes; however, our menu variety allows students to select items that meet their dietary preferences. Parents or guardians are encouraged to plan ahead with their students using the IPS Foodservice menus. Additional questions can be directed to an IPS Foodservice Registered Dietitian by calling 317-226-4772.</p>

<h2>Based on committee feedback, one of the potential solutions is to expand/replicate high demand, higher-performing programs. Which school specific program would you be most interested in expanding or replicating (ex: CFI, Butler Lab, dual-language, Montessori, visual/performing arts, STEM, etc.)? IPS Affiliation Phone E-mail Try to replicate programs elsewhere if you believe that will work. Also, it's not just the programs that work or a model that makes a school successful.

We specifically left a township elementary school for a 2-8 IPS school because our child was being lost in the shuffle of a k-5 school with over 700 kids. He did not know the principal or counselors and they didn't know or care about him and his needs. When teachers changed mid year, he and his classmates were just 1 out of 30 elementary classes in the school that barely recognized they existed and no support was provided. There was no community because there were so many young kids going through the school, and middle school was equally overwhelming for our neighbor who moved to a stand alone middle school. We do not want IPS to replicate the huge and impersonal township schools. They are not better or "right." The gift of the various models in IPS and K-8 is that students get to choose between the existing k-8 schools or transition to one of the existing 6-8 middle schools if they want. K-8 and 2-8 schools mean that families that want to be in a community where there child is known and honored as individuals are supported by staff and administration from elementary through the turbulent middle school years. Students struggling with stability at home are able to have stability and a supportive community and staff at the same school from elementary through middle school with the combined elementary and middle school model.</li><li>Additionally, replicating does not mean changing. The K-8 and 2-8 schools are doing well as K-8 and 2-8 schools. "Replicating" them in other areas of the city would mean creating more K-8 or 2-8 magnet schools in other areas if those neighborhoods want them after doing proper community needs assessments. It is the opposite of the scientific method IPS teaches to change more than one variable when testing a replication. The variable you are already planning to change is opening program specific magnet schools in different neighborhoods with varying populations. Also changing the configuration of the schools to k-5 and k-8 adds another variable that could cause these models not to work in different areas with different populations.</li><li>Dual language</li><li>STEM</li><li>STEM</li><li>Visual/ performing arts, or STEM</li><li>dual-language and STEM</li><li>Yes, with proper training and vetting of staff.</li><li>Dual-language, Montessori, and Visual/Performing Arts</li><li>n/a</li><li>visual/performing arts, STEM</li><li>Montessori</li><li>dual-language! There are so many students that would benefit from the opportunity to improve their Spanish heritage language skills and I feel like in a city our size we should be offering more in this area.</li><li>Montessori</li><li>visual/performing arts</li><li>Montessori</li><li>any! In all neighborhoods</li><li>Montessori, other K-8 schools</li><li>Performing arts/STEM</li><li>I like the flexibility of neighborhood schools and their ability to pull ideas from multiple teaching philosophies. I would like to see the district invest in the neighborhood schools, providing them with the proper funding and supports to meet the needs and population they serve. Our neighborhood schools are the ones serving those transient populations, students with unstable housing, students who are moving into the district mid year. I want to be sure that the district is looking not only at the success of programs on paperbut also recognizing that the populations of students served in the neighborhood schools may not reflect as "success" in the testing scores or stability calculations in the same way. This is because they aren't serving the same students. I want to see the authentic community engagement, the accessibility of having programming/extra curriculars close to home, and the connections built in my neighborhood school replicated throughout the district.</li><li>I believe that our district and students would fair well with a Performance Arts Academy. As a parent of 2 Broad Ripple Graduates, a GWHS Alumni, and employee I have see the results of a program that provides our students opportunities to express themselves in a positive manner. When we had magnet programs, Broad Ripple was one of the top programs in the district, and produce students who are now making their mark in the Entertainment industry Today, and in the world. But more that that those students were stellar scholars academically as well. Behavior issues were very minimal, and the student body and staff thrived. For those students who are not interested in sports, they need an outlet to allow them to express themselves creatively, which will greatly reduce the stressors and mental issues they have to deal with daily. If the district is interested in truly providing social and emotional outlets for our students, then I believe that investing in comprehensive performance arts program, that could feed our students into post secondary opportunities in the Arts, would benefit our students greatly. Students are constantly asking me about dance, music, poetry, visual arts, digital art etc., but there is no where in the direct, nor in Indianapolis for them to fulfill their passion to create in the area of performance arts. Granted we have many dance studios throughout this city which our students could attend, however the main obstacle for many is financial/transportation. Parents do not have $165 per week for dance classes, or time to sit for a 2 hour practice 3 times a week, etc. Please reopen Broad Ripple, and please make it a performance arts CTE Program.</li><li>Dual language. My child began pre-k at GPA 44 as a non-native speaker of Spanish. We are extremely pleased with the immersion model and see the personal growth in their language skills in both English and Spanish. The cultural aspect of learning directly from a native speaker in addition to rounding out the language immersion with cultural integration is a winning combination.</li><li>We see much value in the Montessori, but they all have merit.</li><li>Montessori</li><li>Montessori</li><li>?</li><li>Montessori</li><li>Dual language and visual performing arts.</li><li>STEM</li><li>Montessori</li><li>Montessori</li><li>Dual language</li><li>Stem</li><li>Butler Lab</li><li>It's clear the charter/lottery schools are the only IPS schools performing at close to acceptable standards.

I don't like the expansion plan for that reason.</li><li>High ability</li><li>STEM</li><li>Montessori</li><li>I like IB and Montessori as my children had good experiences in those programs.</li><li>I think this is fine if it's what the parents at neighborhood schools also want.</li><li>I suggest the district work to have a balance of program options available equally across the district, and encourage like programs to work together across the district as teams to share resources, training, and potentially even faculty/staff. (The geographic spread might be harder given the way IPS has already concentrated these high-demand programs on the north side.)</li><li>None</li><li>Montessori</li><li>The current model is successful. A Montessori school from PK thru 8th is the model. Replicate the model in other parts of the school district if that is what the community wants.</li><li>I would love to see a variety of offerings in various neighborhoods and I am deeply invested in Montessori but I don’t think the model is what leads to better outcomes.

I also know that Montessori classrooms are expensive (2 teachers per class, specific materials needed, specific size of classrooms needed, etc). Because of this I have a lot of questions and concerns about the affordability of adding Montessori schools to the IPS district although I would love to see it happen. I don't have experience with the other schools/programs so can't speak to them.</li><li>I also wonder what efforts will be put into recruiting and removing barriers (communication, transportation) for families who are not in any of the choice schools to attend a choice school which would be completely new to them. Is there a way to put effort and support into improving existing neighborhood schools and/or transitioning neighborhood schools to become specialty schools?

It’s a no-brainer!</li><li>Arts</li><li>Whichever format has the biggest waitlist</li><li>I would be most interested in continuing the current schools and adding/expanding additional schools in underserved areas. Instead of replicating schools that work well in the current settings in new settings, wouldn't it make more sense to come up with additional specialized schools that serve the needs of each neighborhood? In the previous survey, we were asked about equity and how re-structuring schools with a broad-stroke changes to the district was the only way of increasing equity. However, this survey doesn't even contain the word equity. Why has the content of the survey changed? It's bit confusing to have answered all the previous questions regarding equity issues in the district and how the new solutions would work into what schools that I want to see continue. Given the previous questions, I think it's clear that we cannot simply replicate what works well in a completely different setting and expect it to work well. Instead, why not keep the schools but update/improve those in underserved communities to increase equity and meet the specific needs of the community that surrounds each school? For example, Sidener academy has done a great job representing the overall district's diverse make up of students (in terms of income and race/ethnicity) while serving high ability students with individualized plans with many twice exceptional students. I think the Sidener academy is the ideal model to replicate as it serves many different needs (across the district given the students come from all over the district) and has done an exceptional job at that. I think simply replicating what currently works well isn't the only or the best solution but since I am being asked to choose one, I would say Sidener given its excellent commitment to its students, how diverse it is, how well it serves its community members, and how it allows highly individualized education and instruction within a public school setting.</li><li>All - I feel the variety and choice is the most appealing. It would be wonderful to be able to chose based on which school fit my child and not a lottery to which can they get into</li><li>I am interested in learning more about how you define high performing. It is clear that picking up a model and putting it into another area isn't working yet. Look at 27 compared to 70 and 84 in ILEARN results. I live on the south side, and Skillen, 19, and Brandes have awful ILEARN results. Skillen barely moved from 21 to 22 in ILEARN and Supper School 19 WENT DOWN! 19 already is a different model, and it is not working. The only schools to grow in my area were Emma Donnan and 65. We are moving our family to Emma because of this.</li><li>I believe the programs that should be first replicated are the programs where demand can sustain them by using Enroll Indy data to look at school selection priorities within the zip codes of the applicants.</li><li>No preference. Any of them would likely do. The focus should probably be where those new programs are offered. Where are the students that want to get into these programs but are being waitlisted? Which have the longest waitlists? Focus there first.</li><li>Montessori</li><li>This is a good idea but will you hold them accountable? I don't get how you all still partner with KIPP.

Some innovative and charter schools are lining someone's pocket. If these programs are truly for children, they will be happy to share their programs with those neighborhood schools .Teachers are not always allowed to be in the union in such schools. This could be seen as a way to weaken the Union representation. If you are looking at duplication programs not school structures then that is a different thing.

These schools that are "high demand/high performing" are because there is parental involvement - this cannot be replicated, however in schools that are underperforming perhaps more educational/social work resources can help bolster the students at these schools. I feel the premise of making schools more equitable by expanding options is going to further leach the system/budget and would again redirect resources to expanding services/offerings to schools that are "under performing". When the students at the Charter school that closed were offered priority in the 2nd round of lottery how many students opted for a high demand school? Perhaps Butler Lab #60 was a highly chosen school but this is probably in large part of proximity to the school that closed and economics/time of getting students to schools further away.</li><li>Butler Lab</li><li>butler lab but a single building/no trailers</li><li>Butler lab, dual-language, STEM.

Regardless of ranking, we opted to start our kids in a private school that offered Reggio/student led learning. As a mother concerned most with my children’s emotional health and facilitating an enjoyment for learning, and an occupational therapist who believes that people will improve and succeed when they feel engaged and empowered to do so, I was not interested in test scores of other students to prove the school’s worth, but more about how our children felt walking in and out of school every day. When we started to think about moving to the Indianapolis area, we explored our options. In Indianapolis proper we are, as we are all aware, surrounded by and possibly “competing” with several highly ranked districts. We chose IPS, and specifically the CFI model because it seemed to be a nice blend of what our kids have been used to and a traditional (albeit necessary) track with testing, state standards, and the hope for a neighborhood school where kids on the street all go to the same school.</li><li>We navigated the open seat report and snagged a spot at 84 mid year to avoid the dreaded lottery (even though we did live within priority zone). We have been happy at CFI 84 but I admit I feel uncomfortable with the disconnect with other IPS schools. I fully believe that if we invested in training for making ALL schools more student led, as the CFI model is intended to be, we would lead to the district as a WHOLE being a proud choice for current and future families and students. The idea of knowing some schools are well known in the area while others are avoided is, in my opinion, a huge problem for the district (and ultimately the city), so trying get more kids into certain (desirable) schools is NOT the answer. By doing so, the district is admitting that some schools are “better” than others and versus taking on the challenge to spread the wealth of knowledge that is available.</li><li>Inquiry based learning could be a part of all of our schools by sharing the resources of those educators who have successfully instituted the methodology for IPS in the past. Social services such as emotional coaching and occupational therapists should be increased to assist with teaching kids they way they need to be taught. If IPS wants to be well known, desired, and most importantly, successful in preparing our youth for the challenges of our current world, how about creating a master program centered around mental health? Imagine kids being evaluated, monitored, and provided resources or modifications for their own personal challenges as it relates to their learning in the classroom. Think, an IEP like file for mental and emotional health. Now, THAT will shake things up and put IPS on the map.</li><li>I propose we 1) share resources, 2) improve all schools, 3) create a master mental/emotional health program that serves student and sets the bar for other districts.</li><li>CFI</li><li>CFI (only if it’s actually replicated.

For too long, these programs have been focused in a very narrow geographic strip between downtown and the northern edge of the district. I'd love to see a CFI at School 57. However, to be done well, the process cannot be rushed. One of the reasons CFI has been so successful is that it has expanded slowly and deliberately, always liberally seeding new schools with strong faculty experienced in the concept. Just throwing out a bunch of new schools with the CFI name does not mean a replication of the existing quality. For example, School 56 is a Montessori school in name only. Most of the faculty are not trained in the method, and most of the classrooms are not equipped with the necessary materials. And the school has not been successful. It takes a year to two years of intensive work for a teacher to become fully trained in Montessori, and the training is not inexpensive. So expanding these programs is a serious and expensive proposition. I believe it's a worthwhile investment. But the effort could backfire if pursued too quickly and without sufficient care. Another request: could we please expand the Spanish immersion program through middle school and high school? It seems unfair to offer a powerful dual-language program through grade 6, and then have nowhere for those students to go to continue the experience. Many of them are too high-functioning in Spanish (especially orally) to get much out of the Spanish offerings currently offered in the higher grades. (If there were at least Spanish options designed for native speakers, that would help.) Lawrence Township has a successful model of what Spanish immersion can look like throughout the K-12 experience, including overseas experiences in Spanishspeaking countries for high schoolers. Please be thoughtful and intentional as you proceed. Quality before quantity.</li><li>CFI</li><li>CFI</li><li>CFI and Butler Lab</li><li>Dual language and CFI</li><li>CFI</li><li>Both CFI and Montessori sparked my interest when I researched them further.</li><li>CFI</li><li>CFI84</li><li>Cfi, stem</li><li>CFI</li><li>Cfi</li><li>CFI</li><li>The CFI and Butler Lab models seem to be thriving and worth replicating.</li><li>CFI.

My child attends CFI and I think the IB program is amazing and should most definitely be replicated, but I know that it's a different training for teachers and can take some time to get a new school going.</li><li>I feel like the CFI program is at capacity and at risk of being watered down with 4 campuses, however the other programs only have 1-2 campuses and should be in consideration for replication.

I actually just moved my child out of a CFI school because I didn't think it was performing all that well.

We have been both a Butler Lab and CFI family and have found both exceptional.

Prior to enrollment, we were interested in a variety of options and our CFI placement was the result of the lottery.

I love the programming! I've thought for a long time that if we could make those programs more accessible by replicating them our district would be in a better. The Butler Lab schools are also amazing, even for our behavior kids.</li><li>I only have experience with CFI, but the model was extremely appealing when determining school plans for our oldest son. Our experience has reinforced that appeal. During the pandemic, many aspects of the CFI model were altered or prohibited and the impact of even those smaller changes (group work, sitting in clusters, hands on activities) had a very negative impact.</li><li>The CFI K-8 school is why my student is in IPS. If that program went away or changed to a K-5/6-8, then I would strongly consider taking my student out of IPS. It will no longer be a unique and alternative community. I could put my student anywhere for that type of program.</li><li>CFI, Montessori, dual language</li><li>CFI</li><li>CFI or Montessori</li><li>CFI</li><li>High Ability Magnet, CFI, STEM, dual-language, Butler Lab</li><li>Cfi</li><li>CFI</li><li>CFI</li><li>CFI, STEM,</li><li>I am not sure that programming is necessarily the solution. What seems consistent among all of these programs is a the smaller community k-8 school. My children attend a CFI school and I am engaged and committed to that program for my children, but can’t assume that is the best learning strategy for all students.</li><li>CFI</li><li>CFI, Butler, STEM</li><li>CFI and performing arts</li><li>CFI, Butler Lab</li><li>CFI, dual language and Montessori</li><li>As the parent of a CFI student, I would be opposed to expanding class size at current CFI schools as I believe the student-to-teacher ratio is a strong draw. Within CFI, it would be great to see a bigger focus on STEM and emerging technologies (computer science, machine learning, etc.)</li><li>CFI</li><li>Butler lab and cfi</li><li>Montessori and CFI</li><li>CFI</li><li>CFI</li><li>CFI or Montessori</li><li>We are sending our student to school 84, which is a CFI school. Every parent I know who sends their student to a CFI school is happy with the program, so I would be in favor of replicating more CFI schools.</li><li>CFI</li><li>CFI</li><li>CFI and Butler Lab</li><li>CFI, STEM</li><li>CFI</li><li>Whatever programs work for the most kids.

I do think high-ability, structured programs are beneficial as well. I think career focused (even at a young age) is important so students know that not everyone requires a standard 4-year college degree. Hands on programs &amp; interest for future careers is important.</li><li>Butler Lab and/or CFI</li><li>Whichever create the best opportunities for student success. My four kids have all been CFI students and that program has worked well for 3/4 of them. I think CFIs are popular with parents but that model is not right for every student. Having options is important. I also think it’s important to look at which school models have worked for kids who whose demographics are more like the demographics of the district as a whole. Kids who live near #84, for instance, would maybe do well at almost any school. They have a lot of advantages to start with. So, priority should be for replicating schools that well serve the kiddos they would be serving.</li><li>I tutor students from CFI schools that are not being taught how to read in the classroom using scientifically researched methods. I would support classroom wide instruction of reading before replicating programs that are not serving all of the students. If the data shows a program is successful for all students not just a few in a school, community opinions should not influence this decision.

<h2>Another potential solution raised is to address grade configuration. This would mean the district transitioning to K-5 buildings, 6-8 buildings and high schools (9-12). Doing this would align IPS with surrounding districts in supporting an elementary and middle school specific model.</h2>

<h3>What is one benefit to realigning the grades?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>More room for students. I know our school is packed to the gills. If it were just prek to 5,!there would be more room for students.</li><li>Grades 6-8 (the preteen aka puberty years) is prepping young students for HS.</li><li>I see no benefit.</li><li>This alignment has been tried in the past by IPS. But it was abandoned because children do better in a K-8 continuity education environment. No benefits with realignment.</li><li>Similarity to other school districts</li><li>There is no benefit to realigning the grades when you are talking about Montessori curriculum.</li><li>I see no benefit actually</li><li>I cannot see one now.</li><li>Better prepare kids for high school.</li><li>Don’t know</li><li>Consistency</li><li>I do not see a benefit</li><li>I feel this is a great solution alignment with the surrounding districts and because I feel the 6th grade in a 6-8 building is a better fit for our students as they are preparing for middle school and still need to be separated from the high school students. I also feel this break down is great and helps keep children in a school community where they can grow and stay safe.</li><li>Better transition between grades</li><li>Putting all student on the same curriculum.</li><li>Middle schools programs would be able to meet the specific needs of secondary students. Currently our k-8 buildings sacrifice too much programmatically to accommodate both sets of students in the same space.</li><li>No. Realigning grades is a bad idea. A ips middle school would be a terrible idea. The k-8 is what makes ips attractive to lots of families.</li><li>Separating the younger children from middle grade is safe in these days we're living in.</li><li>Utilizing space.</li><li>None. Very much against this idea.</li><li>I prefer my young kids to have a chance to have elementary without being around kids who are far advanced in terms of puberty. It's familiar to me and seems less spread thin in terms of accommodation.</li><li>None. We like that CFI 2 is K-8</li><li>More kids per grade allows for more seats in those grades in those schools. Increases building utilization. Encourages availably of extra curricular activities by having a higher density of similar age students</li><li>No benefit</li><li>Specialized teacher who can touch many, if not all, students in the school.</li><li>Hopefully less kids in a building</li><li>None that I can see at the moment. Would be hard on all communities who have older siblings caring for young family members.</li><li>Potentially expanding access to popular programs.</li><li>I don’t see any benefit and believe many families choose a K-8 school because of the benefits of having siblings together. Plus I feel the middle school aged children benefit from having younger kids in the building. I believe it helps keep them in line and potentially dissuades them from “teenage” type behavior.</li><li>I can’t think of a single one.</li><li>Align with surrounding districts</li><li>It’s familiar because it is how I grew up. But I wouldn’t recommend it. Middle school represents some of my most difficult memories.</li><li>better sports and performing arts, orchestra. more stratified according to ability</li><li>Please don’t do it. We like our school k-8 and would like to keep our children at the same school.</li><li>Each lower, middle and upper schools would have the ability to become more concentrated in their grade groups. This includes extracurricular activities, sports, Clubs, etc.</li><li>I don’t like this at all! We want it to stay as is.</li><li>I don’t like this at all! We want it to stay as is.</li><li>The benefit to the non-teaching personnel is that realigning avoids eliminating superfluous positions that currently drain desperately needed resources from classrooms, teachers, and the students we serve.</li><li>It would keep the age ranges in better aliment.</li><li>The teachers that teach specials such as art/Spanish can focus on one level vs two</li><li>IPS' current stand alone middle schools are not offering what the k-8/2-8 schools do, so I do not have faith that breaking apart successful schools will result in more positive experiences for students overall. This seems to be only about cost savings and closing buildings and not actually improving the quality of schools for all students in the district. If it were, then the focus would be on improving schools across the district rather than dismantling schools that are providing excellent educations to students and are the heart of our communities.</li><li>There are a multitude of reason why I believe this is an appropriate transition that is critical for the success of our students. These grade configurations would support appropriate peer to peer interactions and foster an age appropriate experience inside each building. Our "middle schoolers" in K-8 buildings are at a complete disservice and we are setting them up for failure as they are thrown into high school with no transition of educational experience. Our 6-8th graders have to be walked everywhere in our building by an adult (gaining to skills of independence), they have to wait outside bathrooms if younger students are using them, and do not get to experience any traditional programs like band, orchestra, choir, and other extra-curricular classes. I could not be more excited for the prospect of these changes.</li><li>I believe this is the best configuration: K-6, 7-8 and 9-12.</li><li>It would make all of IPS the same.</li><li>Less kids all in one school, making smaller class sizes hopefully.</li><li>It would align with the other districts.</li><li>I have seen both ways be productive.</li><li>Curriculum alignments occur more frequency at the K-5 level and 6-8 level</li><li>not sure</li><li>Middle school needs their own space, teachers that know MS kids</li><li>Sports</li><li>It would be nice if all schools followed the same configuration. It can get confusing to have K-6 and K-8 buildings and is hard to explain to parents. It would also help if students move throughout the district to not have to adjust as much.</li><li>None.</li><li>One benefit to realigning is the decrease in older student older student interactions and hopefully more focus on their needs of the age group</li><li>I really don’t see a benefit. There is scientific evidence to support the K-8 model. Older students have the opportunity to be leaders/mentors earlier and for longer periods of time. 6-8 students benefit from remaining in a safe comfortable environment at a time in their development that is difficult emotionally and physically. They are then more prepared for the high school environment. A district-wide K-8 realignment would be a choice that is in the best interest of all IPS students. And, a district that is willing to make a decision based on the best possible outcome for their students, regardless of what neighboring districts are doing, should be the norm.</li><li>Easier transition to HS. More in line with neighboring districts</li><li>I don’t see it, the k-5 or k-8 have been more successful. The 6-8 model for IPS has been a disaster.</li><li>Safety/Security for younger students being in same space as older ones.</li><li>More resources centralized for students, specifically programming in middle school.</li><li>A focus on middle school. I was at a CFI and due to age; behavior problems start to surface and be more impactful in middle school. I think schools need to be specifically middle school focused to deal and focus on middle school issues. It’s an integral and often difficult age for many children.</li><li>Not only will we be able to focus on academics, but develop age appropriate programs designed to tandem child development &amp; learning stages. I also believe that the district should implement Jr. High Schools - grades 7-9, or implement freshmen academies. 9th graders are just not ready for high school, need more transitional time and training. Too much Too soon.</li><li>Safety. Keeping groups of students who may be relatively close in their physical and emotional progression together has an opportunity to create a safer learning environment.</li><li>I can see how it would benefit this district administration. Under other circumstances I would agree it is generally better for youth as well.</li><li>Middle and high schools could be designated innovation schools, allowing children access to these curriculum longer while in IPS. Student retention in HS aged children is lower due to the lack of diverse curriculums, that many of our children learn throughout their earlier years.</li><li>I’m opposed to re-aligning the grades.</li><li>More focused teachers and administrators</li><li>I don't know. It seems like a lot of disruption.</li><li>To give students the experience of a school transition prior to entering high school.</li><li>You’d separate out the middle school kids so they can go be punks together and not be such bullies to the little kids.</li><li>Provide better, developmentally appropriate school experiences to middle school students</li><li>NO Benefit - This is a terrible idea! Please don't do this!</li><li>Not in favor</li><li>Not in favor</li><li>Historically, test scores are better in K-5, so they are not affected by the rigor and transitions of middle school.</li><li>SEL needs are very different for grades K-5 than they are for kids in 6-8. More focus could be placed on grade-level appropriate SEL. 2) If IPS continues with the Charter/lottery model, blending those kids with the "regular" school kids may help those kids who weren't fortunate enough to get a lottery spot.</li><li>If it would really help with equity, that would be a benefit.</li><li>One benefit would be the possibility of siblings staying together. Another would be schools may be able to reach their seat capacities.</li><li>Consistency across the district and aligning with other districts seems to be the only benefit. It is not a sure thing that realigning the grades across the district would have any real educational benefit. Diversity of choice is one of the strengths of IPS, including differences in grade configurations.</li><li>keeping the bigger kids(6) away from the younger children</li><li>peer socialization</li><li>6-8 kids get an environment set up specifically for there social emoti0nal and academic needs. Staff that is trained and committed to this age level of students.</li><li>While K-8 buildings give 7th and 8th graders a more intimate experience, closer to home, closer to younger siblings, and in a smaller less intimidating surroundings, I believe 7th and 8th graders miss out on a "true" middle school experience. Since middle school is a time for students to prepare for high school. 7th and 8th grade students would benefit from having opportunities that prepare them better. The opportunity to take a more diverse class schedule (band, choir, specialized art classes, or high school subjects for high school credit - like foreign language, algebra, biology). They would also be in a larger building that is similar to a high school experience.</li><li>More standardized with outside districts</li><li>It would be nice to be streamlined with other districts and offer more access to choice programs for higher grade levels.</li><li>I don’t know.</li><li>Giving kids the real "middle school" experience by allowing them an in-between stop before high school.</li><li>You are allowing the 6th graders to start learning the basics of what they will need as far as structure how to rotate classes and ultimately preparing them for high school.</li><li>One benefit of realigning the schools would be to prepare students for the next phase of their education. Particularly middle school students. Middle school students take longer to make the transition from Elementary school such as changing classes, working with diverse groups of students and faculty, more responsibility for tasks, themselves and following different flow of activities and different paces. Some students in MS may need more time to grasp some of the skills. If they are in the MS environment for a longer period of time, there would be no need to keep a student to repeat a grade.</li><li>6-8 distribute the load</li><li>More access to early elementary schools that are high performing</li><li>Sending students to a different building in 6th grade would allow them the opportunity to meet new teachers, new students, and the experience of transitioning to a new building and environment.</li><li>Decreases parents concerns about younger students being exposed to inappropriate behavior</li><li>Middle schoolers have very specific needs, it’s a very specific time in life and learning. I fully support creating buildings filled with educators and staff who love middle schoolers, with all their challenges and rewards. I also fully support middle schools as I think going from an 8th grade class of 40-50 kids to a huge high school is too much.</li><li>None. I believe the K-8 is the best answer</li><li>None. This will damage existing schools and communities</li><li>I don’t see the benefit. I like the continuity and community of K-8.</li><li>All schools would be similar and easier to transition to next school new with everyone else</li><li>More focused curriculum for relevant age groups</li><li>None. This will damage existing schools and communities</li><li>I can’t think of any - I’m absolutely against this.</li><li>None</li><li>Students would be able to meet new grade level peers, but being a part of a k-8 school already, I as a parent and my incoming 6th grade don't want this option.</li><li>Prek programs at all elementary schools?</li><li>None. It would take away from schools that have built a strong community and safe space for their kids including relationships that push for growth, success, and trust.</li><li>I like the k to 8 option</li><li>I don't see any benefit to doing this, especially for families with multiple children and without access to busing.</li><li>I see no benefit of realignment.</li><li>Middle school students should be separate from elementary, expected to perform at a higher maturity than elementary students</li><li>None. It would be devastating to do away with the K-8 model.</li><li>More course offerings- however I would like to hear more about what the options being considered are .</li><li>Making more space for younger students in popular elementary schools.</li><li>More focused resources based on grade levels</li><li>I honestly can’t think of one.</li><li>Less crowded schools (easier drop-off and pickup)</li><li>I'm not particularly in favor of this option and don't think it offers much merit other than possibly helping with space and funding issues.</li><li>There is no benefit. If IPS had any organizational capabilities at all perhaps more extracurricular activities could be offered but IPS has no capabilities to do that (just look at the high schools as an example)</li><li>Allows more students to access school specific programs already available</li><li>Smaller class sizes, More schools being opened to accommodate this adjustment</li><li>Giving middle schoolers a feeling of progression. Moving on to middle school is a rite of passage.</li><li>More resources/options/support for extracurricular activities</li><li>More access to higher level classes and specials in middle school</li><li>I prefer the community of more grades together/neighborhoods stay together</li><li>Enhanced middle school experience with more curricular and extra curricular options; increased integration of students across communities</li><li>I can't think of one.</li><li>Less crowding perhaps.</li><li>I don't see any benefit. Aligning with other school districts is not a reason.</li><li>Teacher: student ratios</li><li>I went to school with the elementary/middle school model (K-5/6-8) and it seemed to work well. So, from my personal perspective, the benefit is that it aligns with my experience. Not saying much, but it is something</li><li>Possibly better focused learning.</li><li>students in buildings other than PreK/K-5 would have a true middle school experience. Possibility of more sports, activities, clubs…</li><li>kids feel special but also more cohesive being near similar ages/grades</li><li>NONE - separating middle school students is a disaster</li><li>A benefit would be not having 8th graders in the same building with Kindergartners. As I have witnessed at our IPS school, middle schoolers running through hallways being loud, rambunctious, swearing, etc. That’s a middle schooler. They should be allowed to be who they are. Having 5 &amp; 6 yo kids witnessing that? No thanks. BUT, having middle school IN elementary schools could be super advantageous. Middle schoolers could be given more leadership roles within the school, mentor the younger kids, work with them on projects. I wish our school did more of that.</li><li>If a school is not performing well in its existing model, I think iteration and change makes complete sense. If a school is doing well, I do not think there is a benefit.</li><li>I don’t see any</li><li>I do not think that reconfiguring the grade levels across the board is a fit for many of the choice programs. Many parents choose IPS schools for their children BECAUSE of the fact that they offer a K-8 model in the same building. I would strongly consider pulling my children out of their IPS choice program if the building transitioned away from being K-8. Multiple options for educational methods and building configurations is one of the primary reasons parents CHOOSE and KEEP children in IPS.</li><li>None for the children- they benefit from being together, leading and modeling the way.</li><li>More extra-curricular options for 6-8. More streamlined focus on facilities for middle grades.</li><li>Ideally better facilities and more robust extracurriculars.</li><li>I can see how it will probably save the district money.</li><li>None</li><li>Consistency</li><li>I don't see any because the middle schools will not be segmented into Montessori, Reggio, IB, etc. The middle schools grades at choice schools are successful because of the school and that school community. IPS will be setting up the students for failure to enter high school.</li><li>If it means more efficiently used resources that can be spent closer to the children who need them, that would be a big benefit.</li><li>nothing - I think the younger kids benefit from seeing the older kids in their schools. The montessori method is built upon community learning and it would be reduced by realigning the grades.</li><li>To keep the kids within age appropriate environments.</li><li>literally not a single benefit</li><li>I don't believe there is a benefit. The best performing schools at the moment are the K8 schools. Why should they be changed?</li><li>Equity</li><li>I'm not sure but I'd imagine that realigning the grades could offer more opportunities for electives/specialized extra curricular experiences if middle schools were able to share staff and resources.</li><li>Separation of age groups.</li><li>We are already in this model at #74 but it’s so disappointing there is not an immersion school option for middle and high school</li><li>Don't change a thing</li><li>This is could allow for more academic differentiation for high achievers.</li><li>As of now, I do not see any benefits to realigning the grades. I think even the word "realigning" is unfair given it's making IPS out of balance/alignment instead of just having a different structure. I do not understand why the district needs to have the same structure of other surrounding districts. In the past survey, it was mentioned along with the building utilization but that just seems to commoditize kids instead of serving kids. I mean, doesn't it make more sense to provide kids continuation of staff/teachers they know. If you want to give more resource to 6-8 grades, why not provide more resources in the current setting? Why do they have to be taken out of what they know and be put into a whole new structure? Anyhow, I do not see any benefit to changing up the grade structure.</li><li>Clear benefits in student experience and the ability for a smaller school feel.</li><li>Research is pretty clear that there is not a benefit to students for this proposal.</li><li>I am honestly having a tough time thinking of one. Perhaps for those that want more of a big school experience for their kids, a larger middle school could offer lots of sports or something along those lines.</li><li>It would benefit some schools.</li><li>Cannot see a benefit to this solution</li><li>Allowing more classrooms per grade in choice schools</li><li>No thanks</li><li>Not to have 5yr old in with 13yr olds</li><li>I feel separating elementary and middle school is a great idea . It separates age levels , maturity levels and would probably be easier on staff</li><li>More space to allow more students would probably mean meeting your budget requirements.</li><li>I don’t there are any benefits, I went through a school system like this and I think it isolates the students too much.</li><li>Less exposure by younger kids to too mature behavior and language</li><li>I agree with the configuring of grades 9-12, but not the other grade changes.</li><li>Safety! Teenagers do not need to be in the same building as kindergarteners.</li><li>I see no benefit. And this is coming from an educator who worked in a middle school building in HSE.</li><li>More elementary student access to smaller school programs that have limited spots</li><li>I have no interest in realigning the grades.</li><li>Consistency across the district.</li><li>I don’t see much benefit considering the research on this topic. Prevailing research shows that k-8 schools are very beneficial for middle school student development.</li><li>Athletics</li><li>I do not think this would be a good idea. One reason we chose IPS was to build a community starting at K all the way through 8th. middle school can be rough: bullying, hormonal changes, peer pressure etc. I do not know benefits of separating the grades.</li><li>There is no benefit to doing this. Surrounding districts do not have better test scores because of this model.</li><li>Specifically, as a Montessori parent, it should remain K-8.</li><li>I can’t think of a good reason.</li><li>I honestly don’t know. One of the main reasons we chose cfi2 is that it is k-8. Please keep some k-8 schools!</li><li>It would keep the facilities planning people busy trying to figure out how to reorganize existing schools into K-5, 6-8, and high schools</li><li>Uniformity/equality across the district</li><li>None</li><li>Not sure</li><li>Potential for more sports/extras</li><li>It is similar to other school districts / townships.</li><li>I really don't understand why you keep going back and forth so much. Change is good and sometimes not.</li><li>Create stronger foundation for students as they transition</li><li>Create stronger foundation for students as they transition</li><li>none</li><li>Can't think of one</li><li>There are few benefits—theoretically more room is created in desired elementary schools. But many of those schools are desired because they are K-8.</li><li>Potentially using existing K-8 buildings to house more K-5 students.</li><li>None. The current alignment works well for families w mixed ages and provides continuity for children.</li><li>I see no benefit at this time. It would make children go through more transitions when stability is what children need most. Parents want the K through 8 model so that they can remain in one building and feel a strong sense of belonging and community. The K to 8 models that exist now work and changing them seems counterproductive.</li><li>Smaller number of students in building</li><li>Sixth graders would have 3 years in the same building instead of just two before another transition.</li><li>I don’t see a benefit. I think it would be tearing apart half the program that is so desirable, the very programs that should be replicated.</li><li>I do not see any benefit from the personal experiences of my three children (now in 7th, 9th, and 11th grade) both at IPS 91 Montessori and Sidener.</li><li>I don’t believe there is one. You stated you wanted to replicate high performing schools. One of the reasons these schools are high performing is due to the multiple age ranges of children. The Montessori method has various ages in the same class. Splitting these grades will impact how this method is organized and will impact the children a growth.</li><li>It could give older kids a more mature environment to prepare for transitioning to high School, but that all depends on execution, and if it's done in a way that keeps the K-5 kids in the district, continues the same teaching methodology and quality if education.</li><li>I see no benefits in this solution</li><li>To get acclimated to a schedule more like high school however students should be starting in 6th grade not just put in 7th and especially not 8th in the middle of middle school experience. Should be phased in</li><li>I believe that all schools should be k-8. All or many of the choice schools are this model.</li><li>N/A</li><li>Unsure</li><li>Not supportive of this change.</li><li>I can understand that numbers wise, it probably makes sense to have middle school buildings include 6th graders. (And I recognize that numbers equates with funding.)</li><li>Not really seeing the benefits yet, especially for the charter schools that are part of specific curriculums.</li><li>None</li><li>None.</li><li>I do not see a benefit to realigning the grades.</li><li>I would imagine that realigning grades might save money; however, specific proposals/building options/ ideas for which schools or teaching pedagogies would coalesce into middle schools have not been articulated to truly be able to evaluate this option or whether realigning would be a financial savings.</li><li>No benefit of realigning the grades</li><li>Prefer my child’s current setting K-8</li><li>I think the benefit is right now there is no 7-8 dual language program that I know of so it would be very wonderful to see a dual language middle school! I am very excited about this prospect for my 2nd grader! also I know some schools are crowded like k-8 so it would give the k-5 more room if 6-8 moved out.</li><li>I would rather see a Montessori option for Pre-K through Grade 12. The Montessori elementary schools from all over the district could all combine after leaving the current Pre-K -6th buildings for 7th-12th in one building centrally located. The facility could be supported by combining the Purdue Polytechnic and/or Herron (as examples) with the Montessori students to share the facility.</li><li>Saving money</li><li>I see no benefit; I prefer the current configuration.</li><li>I don’t want separate middle schools! I hated this growing up and I’m not sure how it would even work for Sidener?? 2-5 what! Also what’s the point with Herron prep. I don’t know any parents that want this change.</li><li>Consistency across the district</li><li>There is no student based benefit.</li><li>I see no benefit to reconfiguration for our school, district families (who would be more likely to have children split across multiple schools), or for students- international educational research and outcomes does not support this as a best practice</li><li>I honestly don't know. Our school is k-8 and I went to a similar model as a child. I like that the younger children get to see the older kids through out the day. And I think it gives the older kids a sense of responsibility to know the younger kids are looking up to them.</li><li>I do not believe there is a benefit to realigning the grades.</li><li>NONE! We just got a K-8 settled In IPS relatively recently. Many of us who have been with the district for years learned over and over again that the middle school model was not working. It feels somewhat tone deaf and Disrespectful to do this to students again. There is so much data that students are safer and learn more in K-8 environments. We literally moved to be close to K-8 school and we love it so very much. Changing this is going to uproot a lot of wonderful things that the K-8 environments have built</li><li>With this option, I would hope IPS would be able to offer high-level courses to all students in 8th grade (Biology, Trig, etc.) currently, those courses are only offered at Sidener, I believe.</li><li>I would expect our MS teachers/teams to be strong, if this plan is implemented in a way that fosters safety, inclusivity, community, and academic rigor.</li><li>Keeping kids in contact with those in their age groups</li><li>Not sure</li><li>Less bullying and less kids being exposed to things they are not yet ready for. Would help major in the learning department as well because kids will less likely want to follow older peers if not seeing the actions being performed. Will slow a lot of violence as well. Less siblings in same schools and will allow children to think for themselves and actually go to school for the right reasons.</li><li>More physical space in current k-8 buildings.</li><li>No benefit</li><li>Expansion of extra curricular options for middle school</li><li>Continuity across district</li><li>The realigning give the opportunity to focus more on age groups and help students have a better opportunity to engage more with peers. It also offers less influences from older students that younger students don't need to be a part of.</li><li>It may help with better building usage?</li><li>There is not one for our family personally. I am sure there is a cost savings for the district.</li><li>Providing more developmentally appropriate resources and trained staff in each building</li><li>Advanced students can be exposed to higher learning and mentored by more advanced students</li><li>Being the same, if that is a goal.</li><li>Would not be good for Montessori model</li><li>I don’t see any benefits to doing this for students, teachers or families. Perhaps it’s more efficient for the district and administrators.</li><li>smaller schools</li><li>No benefit for neighborhood style schools</li><li>I guess more middle school experience for older kids</li><li>More classes per grade when schools close and kids have no where else to go.</li><li>I do not see a benefit</li><li>None. Do not want to reconfigure k- 8 for elementary.</li><li>I see now this may benefit some schools who need rebuilding, however, I do NOT agree with realigning everyone the same way.</li><li>The only benefit for alignment is helping schools who need improvement. However, this has NO BENEFIT if you dismantle models who currently work &amp; who offer a working model to diverse groups of students, which is part of your mission in rebuilding. Why dismantle models who are performing currently to your mission statement?</li><li>I don’t see any. This structure was attempted before by the district and it didn’t work then, hence why we have k-8 schools. Our school is thriving with this model and it’s why many families choose IPS over other options, because they get to be part of a school community for 9+ years and build rich relationships. So again, I see no benefits from grade configuration. Families will, without a doubt, pull out of the district because they won’t trust these new stand alone middle schools will be done well as they were unsuccessful in the past.</li><li>I honestly don’t see a benefit. When I was an IPS student the grades were separated into k-6, 7&amp;8 and 9-12. I absolutely hated having to switch schools. When I heard the changes years ago I love the idea of only having 2 schools especially with the Montessori approach where the older children help/model for the younger kids.</li><li>I do not support this because I have seen the tight community and well-rounded students that have come from the #91 K-8 model.</li><li>Not involved with public schools</li><li>…to be in alignment with surrounding districts while concentrating academic focus.</li><li>None.</li><li>I agree with realigning the grades just not at Sidener or the specialty schools</li><li>Wider variety of Extracurriculars offerings could likely be offered at larger K-5 or 6-8 schools.</li><li>It’s better not to mix 6-8th graders with K-5. Some kids going through puberty and similar things in life won’t respond well with little children around. I don’t like my small children thinking they are 13-14 year olds when they are not since they are more to fall to influences .</li><li>Age related in skill performance</li><li>KDG wouldn't have to be in the same building with middle schoolers. The age differences and behaviors are drastically different. It would also allow middle schoolers to have a true middle school experience and not be part of the elementary set up.</li><li>Separate different age groups so they aren't exposed to so many safety and at-risk factors.</li><li>Back to basics. True middle school experiences.</li><li>Safer buildings and campuses</li><li>consistency</li><li>More access to the middle school opportunities for students currently in k-8 programming</li><li>Reducing the number of different grade levels would make it easier to have the needed supplies, (appropriate desk and chairs, curriculum, etc.) It would give middle schools more equity in sports, programs, and a wider variety of class options. I am at a k-8 building and rules, routines, procedures need to be vastly different for a kindergartener to an 8th grader. Middle schoolers need to be allowed to become more independent that means the whole structure of procedures (from lunch to walking in the hall) needs to be different than younger grades. We are trying to fit them in a metaphorical box that is too small for them. That leads me to talk about classrooms. Elementary building classrooms were build with little kids in mind. Often times the square footage in an elementary classrooms is not big enough for older kids to comfortably fit in a feel like that have space to move. This leads to students feeling anxious and can negatively effect behavior.</li><li>Saving money</li><li>Making traditional middle schools makes sense and it is probably wise to get them away from kindergarten</li><li>Don't do it</li><li>HUGE Benefit to specializing programs for the different grade levels, having more teachers per grade level for planning/sharing ideas. A lot of K-8 building have a huge disconnect between the elementary and middle schools anyways and there are problems with how loud the middle schools are during passing periods (which wouldn't be a problem in a middle school where everyone is passing at the same time). Would be great to open a CFI middle school and then we could have more classrooms per grade level for K-5 (which would expand openings for these grade levels)</li><li>N/A</li><li>A greater ability to focus on the specific academic and SEL needs of that age group</li><li>sameness</li><li>I believe moving grade 6 with the other middle grades would be beneficial. I would also think about grouping 5-6 together and 7-8 with a K-4 model. Also think about moving preschool and kindergarten together.</li><li>I truly don't see one.</li><li>I work at a k-8 school, it is not right for the little kids to go to school with the middle schoolers. The middle school is ran where the kids can go to the lockers, the little kids are around that where the middle schoolers are cursing and setting bad examples.</li><li>I personally believe we should have K-4 elementary schools, so moving to K-5 is a step in the right direction. Sixth graders know too much and are just too grown to be in the same building as kindergarteners and first graders.</li><li>Middle school scores for ilearn would not factored into elementary school scores</li><li>It would beneficial for tracking and leveraging data to assess growth for middle school students as there would be one central locations/group responsible for this task.</li><li>More concentrated age &amp; development range in one building.</li><li>It saves the district money in a tight fiscal environment.</li><li>Student’s social and emotional support would be better suited for their maturity level</li><li>6th grades should not be the oldest in the building</li><li>The age of scholars would be more developmentally appropriate. Students in grade 6 will have more opportunities in middle school than in elementary school.</li><li>Smaller class sizes</li><li>I think 6th graders are ready for middle school and too old and influential to k-5 and I think k-5 would be great for elementary.</li><li>You can standardize everything taught and how taught in district</li><li>None. There are far more behavior issues, less opportunities for participation in sports, less ability to get to know students as the age up. In addition, being a 6th grade teacher at a Montessori school with a second job—I will likely quit teaching altogether. The instability is incredibly draining, frustrating, and maddening. I left a job in Perry township middle school to move to a k-8 building to teach 6th grade simply for the fact that there is more ability to get to know my students, less behavior issues because students already have relationships. Instead of focusing on changing what is working— work to create solid high school programs (ie Broad Ripple arts and humanities magnet) that will keep parents in district after middle school.</li><li>More space in elementary buildings I suppose.</li><li>As a teacher who works in a K-8 building ,I see the 6-8 buildings a s a huge plus. It has been hard to meet the needs of middle schoolers and kindergarteners in the same building. The sixth grade have had to eat lunch with the kindergartners. Thus our kindergartners were exposed to several poor decisions made by our middle schoolers. Middle school students have not been given the opportunity for sports, special classes, and higher level math that my own children were given in their middle school in Pike Township.</li><li>consistency across buildings and their uses</li><li>Unsure - not one I can see</li><li>Traditional</li><li>I don't know enough to contribute to this. Maybe, 6th graders get the chance to be informally mentored by 7th and 8th graders? Might that help with higher behavioral and academic expectations and performance?</li><li>Middle school grades could be more ready to go into a high school setting</li><li>Togetherness</li><li>Better focused academic and extra curricular for the specific age groups</li><li>K-8</li><li>K-5</li><li>Nothing</li><li>Zero benefits</li><li>More room in the building to expand curriculum and extra curricular offerings to students</li><li>Shared resources targeted for age specific groups</li><li>I don't think it's beneficial</li><li>Organizing locations to support the consolidated needs of student body</li><li>I see no benefit.</li><li>There is no benefit. We chose IPS over Washington Twp specifically for the combined K8. IPS will lose families over this.</li><li>Better athletic/extracurricular options</li><li>Consistency in community building and educational growth</li><li>Elementary, middle school, and high schools would each have more space; as well as better focus on the different periods of their education/age group. Especially for middle school, which needs more space for expanding activities. Space for clubs and sports programs. Instead of being crammed into buildings better suited for elementary students. This may also provide more appropriate environments for each age group.</li><li>Grouping kids by like age-group allows schools to better address the children's needs. It could mitigate problem behaviors.</li><li>More resources availability - theater, activities, sports</li><li>I do not see a benefit to this model.</li><li>None</li><li>None, from a parent prospective. We do not want to change grade configuration and do not see this improving overall performance within IPS. This is a cost saving measure that will hurt student performance and will likely push many families out of IPS and to private or surrounding public schools.</li><li>Sports</li><li>None</li><li>None. Aligning with other districts is not a benefit. IPS is unique and should embrace that fact.</li><li>None</li><li>Narrows the range of needs that must be addressed by a particular school building.</li><li>Resources better tuned to student need</li><li>None</li><li>I think with the era our kids are growing up in having smaller schools k-8 is better for mental health, self esteem and continuity ESPECIALLY in the middle school grades. I think one of the reasons some schools are highly sought after is because of this model rather than kids being shuffled off into a middle school once they hit 6th grade. I went to a traditional middle school, though there were probably more opportunities in terms of clubs/athletics etc these were the most difficult years and I would rather my child be in a smaller community during these grades as well.</li><li>Opening up schools for more enrollment</li><li>making more room for elementary school age children in their own neighborhoods</li><li>I think the theoretical benefit is that there will be more classes per grade at a given school, which increases the number of students per grade eligible for enrollment and hopefully the diversity of the students.</li><li>I personally don't see a benefit or need to realign the grades. I don't understand why it is being proposed. We have been constantly told that K-8 models are more beneficial academically and socially for the last few years. I also feel like IPS is rushing such a massive structure change and will be unprepared. The K-8 model seems to be working and I don't understand the push to make such a massive change.</li><li>More difficult, high school credit classes can be offered because there will be a larger population of 7th/8th graders available to make up a class.</li><li>I prefer my kids k-8 set up. I like a small middle school.</li><li>None</li><li>The middle school ages children will gain better experience to prepare them for the high school setting and expectations, which in turn prepares them for life after high school.</li><li>More options for middle school subjects, variety of classes within subject areas, more after school clubs, increased diversity, integration and hopefully inclusiveness and belonging for a wider range of students and staff.</li><li>None</li><li>None- get rid of the charter schools and build strong k-8 schools to build community and pride, support the teachers in general, but also support the teachers’ in their continuing education. If Montessori is popular and effective- pay to TRAIN MORE Diverse Teachers that can be most effective in under served neighborhood schools.</li><li>None. I honestly can't think of a single good thing that would do for families, teachers, or kids.</li><li>None- I do not agree with this proposed change at all.</li><li>None, there are no benefits!!!</li><li>Continuity across district</li><li>None that I can see</li><li>Younger children do not need to be exposed to middle school language and actions. Middle school, grades 6-8, are at a higher maturity levels and their actions influence younger children. They are disrespectful to the younger students. Also, at a middle school, hopefully a security officer works be employed to help teachers with discipline/fights in the hallway. Many teachers are not respected or listened to by the middle schoolers. There is no respect for authority and younger children do not need to be influenced.</li><li>Less stress for specials teachers who see the whole school. It was allow more planning time and I’d be able to focus on strengthening my lessons for a small group of students.</li><li>6-8 works be better able to focus on early adolescents' personal and social development</li><li>6th grade being with peers closer to age as they are approaching puberty. Uniformed across the district where right now it is not.</li><li>More age appropriate atmosphere if we got o new structure</li><li>keeps younger kids out of the high schools</li><li>I believe this model is best for students as it relates to brain maturity levels. In my opinion, 8th grader students should not be in buildings with kindergarten students.</li><li>There would potentially be more opportunities for classes, clubs &amp; sports at the middle school level.</li><li>Giving students in upper elementary grades more leadership opportunities (4/5). Giving middle school students a better transitional period before high school.</li><li>6-8</li><li>Sports and activities for middle schoolers, but there are other ways to achieve that</li><li>Realigning and structuring those grades in different buildings does not bring any new value to the educational process. The focus should be on academics.</li><li>The primary benefit that comes to mind is to expand our children’s' relationships with students from other schools. For example, I don't think it would be bad to have a 6-8 CFI middle school that grabs from each of the existing CFI schools. The only caveat is that I would want to ensure that such a program would mimic the existing MYP program offered at our current school. I wouldn't want the quality of the education (specifically, access to the IB program) to change as a result of grade realignment.</li><li>I do not believe there is benefit in changing to K-5 model.</li><li>There is no benefit, please do not realign them.</li><li>I don't know. I'm guessing the district will save money somehow because I can't see any other benefit. Certainly no benefit to the kids.</li><li>Encouraging age appropriate development</li><li>Just building utilization</li><li>You wouldn’t have 14 and 15 year olds riding the bus with 5 year olds</li><li>I believe that it will allow for a single framework for grade level arrangement and make it more applicable for building supports.</li><li>I don’t see one. We chose IPS because of the K-8 models.</li><li>Since my kids just finished grades K and 3, I do not have any working knowledge pros or cons of splitting up the grades</li><li>However, those with multi kids, it is more efficient to have kids go to one school instead of having to spend valuable time going between schools. Especially as kids activities increase as they get older.</li><li>none. keep CFI k-8</li><li>Focus on early learning which typically runs from birth through age 9.</li><li>Older kids being separate from younger. Consistency with surrounding school districts for extra-curricular activities.</li><li>equal treatment for all IPS students</li><li>I guess older kids wouldn’t be around little kids.</li><li>I don’t want to realign grades. We selected our school because of the K-8 model.</li><li>Aligning with surrounding districts</li><li>None</li><li>More room in elementary buildings.</li><li>None, from my personal perspective.</li><li>I am not sure. Both of my children have thrived in environments where there were a multitude of grade levels. I think there may be some additional camaraderie formed by having middle years together but honestly, have appreciated the varying ages and grades in one building.</li><li>There are no benefits. Doing so would weaken all schools.</li><li>none</li><li>There wouldn’t be older children like 8th graders in the same building as per-k</li><li>More opportunities for specials</li><li>More classes per grade level and variety in the students in class each year.</li><li>Honestly nothing</li><li>I have questions, not answers. Would it help reduce the districts real estate portfolio? I don't understand how that is the case but could be supportive if that's what you are trying to do. Why do you think it would benefit other than aligning with other districts? Message this issue better.</li><li>More capability from nice schools to get more kids like CFI 70</li><li>I don't want to realign the grades. There is HUGE development benefits to the K-8 model for all ages involved. Middle school is such a nightmare for so many kids -why intentionally create that environment when K-8 is working so well??</li><li>None</li><li>I don’t see any benefits due to the challenges in next response.</li><li>a true middle school experience will better prepare students for high school</li><li>I’m not sure</li><li>Having larger facilities to accommodate greater numbers of students</li><li>There is no benefit I am very upset about this potential change</li><li>Smaller classrooms cause families would elect other school options than IPS.</li><li>Middle schoolers will feel like they are in a bigger school without the little kids. More tailored to them.</li><li>A benefit could be more programs for middle school ages (ie language, arts, sports, etc)</li><li>More options for middle school classes</li><li>There is none. Our kids have been through enough transitions.</li><li>No idea</li><li>More seats per school</li><li>Don’t see one</li><li>More teacher collaboration for same grade</li><li>Perhaps adding an additional classroom for each grade at the existing high performing schools, so those schools could accept more students</li><li>I prefer the k-8 model, having my kids at the same school enabled me to go back to work full time.</li><li>Optimizing the tools and resources for the appropriate age groups.</li><li>I do not know of any.</li><li>Better preparation for middle schoolers transitioning to high school.</li><li>I do not see a benefit of realigning the grades. I think the community established in a K-8 school is essential to student development and cannot be achieved in the same manner through K-5 and 6-8 schools.</li><li>None—unless there is a solid solution for putting kids from different schools and different learning programs together, don’t do. Keep the schools aligned as they are.</li><li>I’d like to see the data the district is using to lean this direction, as there is MUCH research that shows the exact opposite- that isolating grades 6-8 leads to poorer outcomes. We personally chose IPS because so many schools were K through 8. I believe that age 12 to 14/15 can be challenging and having the strongest sense of community and confidence during these years leads to success. That being said, I wouldn’t be opposed to a separate middle school as it could mean kids could possibly better prepared for larger population high schools. Also, the ability to focus on the specific needs of the age group is a pro if implemented correctly. Lastly, there could possibly be an increased interest to attend IPS high schools.</li><li>However, it’s the process in which the transition happens that scares me. I think the decision needs to be very carefully thought out, with special consideration for those who are closest to those middle school years. Meaning, there should be some bit of grandfathering for current families in certain grades. Changing a third, fourth, fifth graders schooling can lead to adverse outcomes and potentially a lot of fleeing from the district. If this route is decided, it should be planned for several years in order to be successful.</li><li>If the goal is to open more seats, who will take these seats? Assume a school that has historically been higher ranked in the lottery (CFIs, butler labs) has more open seats, who will take them? A family who can coordinate the transportation to/from a school farther away may assist with some aspect of diversity but only further creates a divide between the schools you want or the schools you don’t. I would love to hear fewer conversations about that topic and more about how the district stands together. I believe supporting neighborhood schools and facilitating school communities are key to making people proud of their option, and ultimately puts less pressure on the lottery system</li><li>No benefit</li><li>I do not support this.</li><li>There is no benefit. You tried this in the past and it did not work.</li><li>Increased diversity.</li><li>None</li><li>Likely more activities available to middle schoolers</li><li>Realigning is not preferred.</li><li>Students get to experience a transition before High School</li><li>None that I see. This idea was not successful when tried at the high school level a few years ago. Shaking things up in the midst of an ongoing pandemic? NO. My son will be in 4th grade; his last normal year of school was kindergarten. My daughter hasn’t had a normal year of elementary because she’s entering 2nd grade.</li><li>Enough with changes. Let teachers, administrators and staff do their jobs as educators for one normal year before trying to make significant changes. Give students to show you what they can do when they are IN school, not sitting behind a screen.</li><li>None</li><li>I do not support realigning the grades</li><li>If the IPS system has not been able to replicate success across the range of neighborhood needs to date, I'm not sure I see a benefit in taking what successes there have been and scattering those across new and theoretical configurations that only appear to be a change, and not an actual solution.</li><li>no benefit that I can see. all it seems to accomplish is realigning for the sake of realigning.</li><li>Specifically cfi school 2 should be keep k they 8.</li><li>There would be no benefit for us in realigning the grades as our children attend CFI2. We chose this school for specific reasons, one being that it is K-8. We are really hoping our children can continue to stay at this school until 8th grade year is complete.</li><li>I can't think of one.</li><li>It would hopefully be more academically rigorous, more diverse, and offer additional musical and language options, with more resources for teachers.</li><li>More buildings available</li><li>I see no benefit, as studies have shown better outcomes for middle schoolers in k-8 schools especially for self-esteem.</li><li>Might allow existing high performing schools to expand capacity.</li><li>There is less of an impact on students who transfer between districts. It can be very impactful if they go from a middle school to an elementary school just because of a district change or vise versa.</li><li>Easier hiring in the middle grades.</li><li>Middle schoolers are unique in the their emotional strengths and needs. I intentionally pulled him from a K-8 program to put him in an IPS middle school. He thrived during these years and explored school and extra curricular options not available at his smaller school. I strongly feel that middle school helped transition and ready him for high school at Arsenal Tech. Many parents that I had talked to said the jump from CFI to high school was a culture shock for their students, especially the jump from CFI to ATHS.</li><li>I see none available</li><li>Absolutely NONE!</li><li>More space for popular schools-less dependency on outdoor classrooms (CFI 2)</li><li>I think having kids from K-8 in the same building can be problematic for the younger kids. The things my incoming 3rd grader has learned and heard from middle schoolers aren’t always great.</li><li>None. Transitioning to all K-8 buildings would be much better.</li><li>Less bullying</li><li>More options.</li><li>Look, this survey design is so deeply flawed it isn't funny. You can't solicit input in this way and call it balanced. One potential benefit is a fresh start across the IPS portfolio. The drawbacks are far greater and completely disruptive.</li><li>The middle years would have better resources for emotional growth/practice for high school, sports programs, music programs, extra curricular activities with their own age groups. You be able to offer more robust programming with a smaller subset of children. Academically I could see better outcomes with 6-8 middle vs K-8. Again resources better aligned for the group.</li><li>I could see a dynamic program if we have strong support and leadership, Potential benefits would be: a focus on middle grade social and academic needs, teacher collaboration (philosophies must align), student choice in courses, and more grade appropriate expectations at the middle school level.</li><li>I don’t personally see one. It seems more beneficial to consolidate with the current alignments.</li><li>With the CFI middle school I could see job alike teachers being able to collaborate better.</li><li>K-8 model needs to be preserved. Period. The return to the balanced calendar with longer spring and autumn breaks and shorter summer breaks also needs to be returned. This will help minimize space between school grades.</li><li>Consistency with what is offered</li><li>More room to add more grade level classrooms with smaller class sizes for more individual student interaction.</li><li>None - terrible idea</li><li>Consistency throughout the district. Giving students in 6-8 more/better opportunities to experience class electives and extracurricular activities. Age groups will be better aligned for their environment.</li><li>In my view, the biggest benefit would be expanding successful elementary programs within the buildings. I think it would hurt the middle school programs.</li><li>None that are worth it</li><li>More focus on that age group.</li><li>A middle ground step to move into an IPS high school. Currently the magnet programs are ditching IPS at a high school level. The eight grade class at 84 didn’t have a single ips incoming freshman last year. Half of them moved to private. Creating a combined middle school I think would help feed into our high schools.</li><li>None</li><li>More support for middle grade teachers &amp; more electives for middle school students</li><li>Honestly can’t really think of one</li><li>None that I can think of</li><li>None. Studies show K-8 schools produce better performing and better prepared students than separating out middle school students.</li><li>Potential for more differentiation for high ability</li><li>Younger kids are separated from the drama that pubescent kids are going through.</li><li>It would make all schools fair and equal. I am pro doing this and was excited when it was announced. It's not fair some students get to benefit from this and most others do not. Most township schools all have middle schools. K-8 only makes sense in rural areas where you may need to do that for teachers/space. Urban areas make no sense to do this. Make all kids on the same changing schedule going to a new school for grade 6.</li><li>I honestly am not sure I see a benefit.</li><li>Better MYP programs</li><li>Separating kindergarten from 8th grade</li><li>I don't see sufficient benefit to justify the change. But it would be consistent with certain other schools.</li><li>This option would create a more natural pipeline for students to remain within IPS for high school. In our current model, I am concerned about my kids having to go from a school where they’ve known the same 50 classmates since kindergarten to high school where they will be with hundreds of students and likely many of their friends will go to other schools since so many leave the district for private high school or another district’s public option. I believe if there was an IB middle school that brought many schools together for sixth grade, then this larger community would more likely choose to stay together for high school.</li><li>academic resources and course availability for 6-8</li><li>Grade appropriate interaction</li><li>like aged kids together</li><li>Sports maybe?</li><li>More room in overflowing schools (CFI, Montessori)</li><li>Can offer more sports I guess but not everyone will be able to play with the large school</li><li>Not sure.</li><li>I do not currently see any benefits.</li><li>Allow more offerings at middle school.</li><li>More diversity</li><li>Improves extra curricular activity options and transition into high school</li><li>Social / emotional</li><li>Development and diversity</li><li>Perhaps easier to compartmentalize age-appropriate language/behavior/issues caused by older and younger kids being in the same building today</li><li>I see the advantage of a streamlined model that would be less confusing for families.</li><li>I don’t see any benefit. How does this improve the quality of education? It feels like it comes down to bodies in a building. ie no impact on quality or content of what is being taught.</li><li>More class opportunities/differentiation</li><li>I strongly disagree with the change and see no benefit in aligning with other districts. I very much hope that we do not change.</li><li>More opportunities for sports and music extra curricular activities.</li><li>Sports opportunities</li><li>Right now, our school is pre-k - eighth. I’ve heard from my child plenty of times that the middle schoolers are always cussing and doing bad things. I don’t think that the children (especially pre school- 3rd) shouldn’t be exposed to this kind of behavior.</li><li>Enabling administrators to be able to focus more on a specific age/maturity group.</li><li>Consistency</li><li>Consolidated resources</li><li>I don’t see the benefit and like keeping 8th grade and lower together</li><li>school potentially less crowded?</li><li>From our perspective, the only benefit would be financial (through a streamlining of facilities/buildings). If that is the driving factor behind grade realignment, it would be a real disappointment. We believe IPS has built some incredible momentum over the past decade, and it would be truly disheartening to see that jeopardized because of facilities issues.</li><li>Other than for extreme budget concerns I don't see any advantage of this.</li><li>More age appropriate schoolmates.</li><li>If the IPS Innovations would not have to also abide by this, I don't think there are any benefits. If they ARE required, then I think it's probably helpful for training. Doing Professional Development for Kindergarten and 8th graders is a very different thing. Kids will understand what it means to be an Elementary Student and what it means to be a Middle schooler. However, there are some surrounding districts that do not have this configuration. I believe currently Warren's intermediate schools start at 5th grade. So I'm not sure choosing to do this to match with surrounding districts should be a goal.</li><li>Helping ease the crowding in high demand programs where the school is beyond capacity.</li><li>I see zero benefit to realigning grades.</li><li>Not sure</li><li>It disrupts communities. None.</li><li>I see this as a horrible idea, as I feel that our child is familiar with her current school and would appreciate CFI-2 being from classes K to 8, due to bus issues and us working it causes an issue with our kids being moved to a different school. Further, IPS has been shutting down schools versus making new schools so this reduce the options available within our radius.</li><li>I do not see one without having high demand, higher-performing programs in place for students to attend in Middle School. You cannot take students from Lab, CFI's, Montessori, Sidener type schools and put them in a regular middle school.</li><li>More age- specific content</li><li>This may allow for an easier transition for middle school kids into HS.</li><li>More options in music and arts for students (orchestra, band)</li><li>Having a transition from 5th to 6th might help kids with the big transition of 8th to high school. Going from a small school like CFI to a much larger high school population, like Shortridge, would maybe be less overwhelming for kids if they fed into a slightly larger middle school in between.</li><li>Studies show that 8h grade students score higher on Math and English tests when attending K-8. Also, students of color do better in K-8 schools.</li><li>Can’t think of one if it’s that age. Consider K-6 and 7-9? I thought research showed that to be the better option for kiddos and transitioning between schools.</li><li>More kids of the same age in the same place will allow for more variety in sports, clubs, and classes.</li><li>There is no benefit to families. The board is only thinking about funding and not our child success.</li><li>None</li><li>I love the idea of K-5 and 6-8. My oldest is going into 8th grade this year at a CFI school. While I loved the K-5 experience, the MYP experience has not been the best. Middle school students have very different needs and are at a very different place in their development as compared to K-5 students. So to try to serve K-8 in one building, I feel like the MYP students' needs were not being fully met. A stand-alone middle school would allow for more class options and activity options with a focus on these specific ages. Additionally, this would free up space in the high-demand schools to add more K-5 students.</li><li>Reduced cost of operating schools.</li><li>Enhanced Middle School curriculum &amp; sports programs</li><li>I see no benefit, other than a vague promise that it wills save money.</li><li>Potentially reducing capacity constraints in buildings</li><li>NONE</li><li>I don’t see a benefit, as K-8 schools preform better and the middle school experience is less stressful for kids with reduced bullying and hazing.</li><li>specializing teachers to scale on a subject.</li><li>Operational efficiencies for district</li><li>I am not a fan of this option.</li><li>Limited</li><li>Social status of the younger children not being as compromised by the upper class students. ex. K-5 children are on a different page from 6-8 graders thus the same for 6-8 to 9-12. Children are at a different stage in their education, hormonal growth, overall development.</li><li>N/A</li><li>Better sports options</li><li>Zero benefit</li><li>I think it would likely make running the schools simpler. I could see this being the case for the school administrations as well as the PTAs.</li><li>A larger, central middle school fed by CFI elementary schools</li><li>Free up space in over crowded K-8</li><li>Middle school could be for all CFIs/Montessoris.etc. Could make room for existing K-8 schools that are at max capacity (i.e. CFI2).</li><li>Do not see the need.</li><li>We chose our home due to the proximity of our K-8 CFI school. We wanted our three children to get a great education within walking distance of our home. My children and I are very much looking forward to all 3 kids being in the same school building together. This is what my husband and I feel makes our school so special. I don't think you will get that by removing middle school students from the building. Please don't!</li><li>This could provide a reset to potentially improve the experience of students at under performing schools, while only risking the students at schools currently meeting expectations.</li><li>I understand the need for better building utilization, but have MANY concerns.</li><li>I don't see a benefit.</li><li>I don't know as I have not heard concrete plans on how this will be implemented.</li><li>I see no benefit in re-aligning grades. I greatly prefer replication to realignment.</li><li>Larger middle schools would allow for more peer socialization/prepare for high schools</li><li>Perhaps keeping the different ages apart is beneficial to some degree however I am in support of keeping k-8 models.</li><li>None</li><li>Centralized middle schools.</li><li>More seats</li><li>Larger classes</li><li>No perceived benefit from my perspective</li><li>Please don’t change the current model.</li><li>Kids going into middle school will get to meet new kids from other schools before starting high school. Middle school teachers will have colleagues in the same subject they can Collab with.</li><li>Ability to offer more choices in classes (English, honors English, algebra, geometry) etc. Less teacher burnout.</li><li>None</li><li>Cannot think of any. If goal is to expand desirable programs, why mess with what is working? K-8 works and is part of what makes the schools desirable. Most, if not all, of the private schools IPS families leave for are K-8. Why not replicate the most popular models elsewhere, if that is what IPS families want? And if the concern is lack of middle school programming, why not offer more middle school programming opportunities at existing K-8 schools?</li><li>It aligns with a more traditional breakdown of grades</li><li>Consolidating could save money</li><li>The feeling of community by attending a school that is k-8</li><li>I don't see the benefit here. Focus on replicating the current K-8 schools that are high performing instead of realigning grades.</li><li>It is hard to think of one because I truly believe K-8 is so beneficial to the students.</li><li>I do not believe there is any benefit to disrupting the middle school kids who are currently in a K-8 school. If IPS moved to a middle school for CFI schools, there needs to be a thoughtful transition plan that is implemented with a two-year advance plan to give students and parents the opportunity to plan for this change. I believe in neighborhood schools not bussing students outside their neighborhoods.</li><li>Middle school is just awful</li><li>No benefits</li><li>None. K-8 should remain the standard, especially in CFI schools so that younger kids can see what older kids are doing and how it all relates and builds.</li><li>Chance for students to interact with different students when transitioning to middle school.</li><li>I guess less students per class because a lot of families will leave</li><li>I’m honestly not sure what the benefit would be. I chose that school we are at currently because of the K-8 model. I liked the idea of him being able to go through until high school. I was in IPS when there were middle schools and honestly it was a mess. I’m not sure how the schools would be or how many students would be attending but there would have to be a lot of hard work for me to be confident in this change.</li><li>More activities available to students</li><li>One benefit would be to better prepare students for high school.</li><li>This gives more students per grade which makes more tailored options feasible within the classroom as well as extracurricular.</li><li>It fits in a nice, neat package on paper. Students may have more course choices in a bigger middle school.</li><li>Middle school experience</li><li>There is NO benefit for our school. Montessori depends on grades working together. We also chose a K-8 school so our child WOULD NOT have to experience a true middle school and all the trauma that comes with it.</li><li>I don't see a benefit outside of financial reasons. We need to prioritize our students' education above financial considerations.</li><li>K-8 models have research to show they are most beneficial educationally / on kids’ outcomes. I would not recommend changing current k-8 schools to k-5 just to make better use of building space.</li><li>more clubs and sports</li><li>Kids from different schools intermingling and developing interpersonal relationships prior to high school</li><li>None. It divides families and forces middle school students to find a new school and transportation. There is currently no IPS middle school near our elementary school. I would be forced to send my 6th grader out of district to private school or Washington Township.</li><li>Unsure at this time.</li><li>Age appropriate amenities and extra curricular activities. Transition with their cohort.</li><li>I understand that a benefit would be greater opportunity for differentiation.</li><li>I see no benefit to realignment. the reason CFI has been successful is the consistency and the k-8 community. realignment would ruin that</li><li>I see no benefit to students.</li><li>To save money is the only reason I can see.</li><li>None. It's stupid. Should stay K-8.</li><li>Configuring with other districts isn’t automatically positive.</li><li>We do not see much benefit. In fact, we would be likely to transition our children to the local private school to avoid this reconfiguration.</li><li>I see no benefits. There is no research I have found that shows a benefit to keeping middle school grades separate.</li><li>None, it would be terrible</li><li>None. The K-8 facilities at the magnet schools perform better than the other middle schools</li><li>No benefits that I see unless the process is well thought out, not rushed…</li><li>I suppose maybe allowing more kids?</li><li>I do not think this would be a beneficial strategy.</li><li>I don’t see any benefits to realigning the grades.</li><li>I worry IPS considers the benefits to be 1) more seats for K-5 kids and 2) reduced costs. However, I feel both are at the expense of 7-8th graders from current K-8 schools.</li><li>More room at current CFI schools for additional classes</li><li>Increasing enrollment opportunities at existing high-performing schools</li><li>I think the magnet schools should stay k-8</li><li>I don’t see this as beneficial</li><li>They’d be moving towards a more traditional experience. But that’s not why we chose our school.</li><li>I really don’t see a benefit.</li><li>As students become older, they can mix with many more students their age rather than the same 50-75 kids at the smaller k-8 schools. More classes, club offerings.</li><li>No benefit.</li><li>none. I believe there are studies showing that K-8s are better than separate K-5s and middle schools.</li><li>Can focus on age-appropriate development. As a parent of an asynchronous child (brain developed before social/emotional), I can appreciate the structure that K-5 would provide for that child, as well as transitioning to 6-8 and providing that next level of social/emotional stepping stones.</li><li>Consistency with other district models</li><li>I know it would free up some seats in currently high-demand magnet programs but that seems like a band-aid. Those new seats would fill up fast and there would still be demand. Also, those seats would remain in the same corridor of opportunity that exists and not reach other neighborhoods that aren’t currently being served with magnet programs.</li><li>I can’t think of any. If I wanted this model, I would have put my child into one of the other surrounding district schools. This is not a benefit to the district.</li><li>Kids are grouped with similar aged learners, and can have experience with change and independence before high school.</li><li>Presumably, more support for middle school focused curriculums with more admin support dedicated to 6-8 grades.</li><li>I don’t believe global realignment makes sense. For example, we chose 84 in part because of the K-8 model and it works great there.</li><li>I do not see any benefit</li><li>I don't see the benefit, I think it is a detriment - K-8 schools are a great thing.</li><li>I don't believe there is a benefit. This was the history of IPS many years ago and did not work well for students or families.</li><li>A recent study in the AMERICAN EDUCATION RESEARCH JOURNAL confirms why a K-8 school is beneficial. Students who attended a K-8 school are more comfortable, feel safer, and ultimately perform better academically than their counterparts at traditional middle or 6-12 schools.</li><li>It's how I grew up</li><li>practice with transitions, clearer instructional goals and helping students learn how to adapt and reinvent themselves</li><li>There is very little research backed evidence to support this approach, the benefits are mostly administrative, not educational.</li><li>I suppose it could allow for more focused interactions among students, but I don't think that's much of a benefit.</li><li>No benefit at all. Again, I see no benefit and I see major negative impact to my children's school and education.</li><li>This makes the most sense. I strongly believe that 6-8 graders should have their own programs and school. This would also make the transition to high school much easier for some of our students and support their developmental needs.</li><li>N/A</li><li>Younger children not being exposed to behaviors of middle school children.</li><li>More seats in choice programs, developmentally appropriate teaching and peer grouping</li><li>Not really any - maybe more class types offered or sports</li><li>More sports or clubs? Maybe more math classes or robotics or computers?</li><li>I don't think there are any</li><li>I don’t know</li><li>Younger kids would not be as exposed/influenced by older kids</li><li>Middle school students will have a true middle school experience tailored to their developmental needs. That is very difficult to do in an elementary building.</li><li>I think middle schoolers should have their own buildings. It gives them a sense of responsibility and prepares them for high school where they do everything without a guide. When middle school is connected to elementary, I think they still feel very “babied” for lack of better words, and that contributes to behavior problems. The students having to walk themselves to class and know when to stop at their locker and things is important in preparation for high school.</li><li>Aside from behaviors, I think realigning the grades would allow for more support to all grade levels. Having a k-8 school means you have 1 person supporting 8 grades versus if you split it, you can have 1 person supporting 5 and 1 person support 3 grades (6-8). It would allow more students to get reached.</li><li>The six graders are not in the same school as early elementary. I feel they would do better in a middle school.</li><li>Maximizing the use of the 4 current middle schools/More specific and targeted instruction at the Middle School level</li><li>Middle school and elementary specialists teaching</li><li>I don't think there is a benefit to realigning schools; I also think there are fewer schools with this model in the surrounding area. Wayne is K-6; 7-8; freshman center; 10-12. Warren is k-4; 5-6-7-8. Perry is k-5, a 6th grade academy and 9-12 schools. I think you need to check surrounding school configurations.</li><li>The only benefit I can think of is that IPS would be aligned with other districts.</li><li>As a middle school educator who has worked both in a combined setting (6-12) and a standalone setting (7-8), I whole heartedly feel that the standalone model is best for the middle grade child. In the standalone environment we can tailor our instruction, interventions, procedures, and policies to best support our students during a unique transition time in their lives. Additionally, it will streamline operations and allow for consolidation which should be budgetarily beneficial to the district as well.</li><li>Consistency for goals within building</li><li>There is a massive difference between the youngest and oldest students in a K-6 or K-8 building, and this will allow for younger children to have a safe environment while giving older students the opportunity to develop with peers closer in age.</li><li>more cost effective</li><li>There is no benefit, and I can promise you you’ll lose a ton of teachers doing this. Data drove IPs to go to k-8 years ago.</li><li>Less negative influence on younger kids</li><li>Better sports teams.</li><li>I would love for my school to be elementary only so we can focus exclusively on k-5. This would also allow the middle school students to have a more authentic middle school experience with more options.</li><li>My hope is that larger middle schools could bring back middle school band for all 6-8 graders.</li><li>In a stand alone 6-8 middle school, you can have more extra programs.</li><li>Students having more of a middle school experience before high school</li><li>There are none unless it is a budget concern, This is NIT putting the interests and needs of our children and families first. These configurations have been a disaster in the past which is WHY parents rallied with a lot of hard work to obtain K-8 programs which continue to be in high demand.</li><li>None</li><li>None</li><li>We should have more K-8</li><li>Opening more spots in current schools</li><li>I only see benefit to the district with cost savings and no benefit to students at this time.</li><li>More room in the current schools to provide for higher number of students; improved middle school programming</li><li>Keeping younger kids out of the difficulties and issues that they are potentially exposed to from the older kids.</li><li>Sixth graders needs would be better met. How will this impact Pre-K?</li><li>New mix of kids in middle school, preparing them for an even bigger mix in high school</li><li>It seems to ease the transition from eighth grade to high school. Perhaps it opens up room for additional classes in thriving elementary schools.</li><li>IPS is more aligned with surrounding districts, more appealing to community members with kids</li><li>I can see no benefit to this.</li></ul>

<h2>What is one challenge with realigning the grades?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>I see the combined model as something that allows kids to really develop a community. I see lots of benefits to this model. I also worry the district would lose students after 5th grade.</li><li>I worry about having just one cfi middle school and how that would affect commute. We picked 27 because it is closest to our house. It is closer than the neighborhood school. We want to be able to walk to school and have the feeling of living in a community.</li><li>Too many transitions. Breaks up any community built amongst students and staff.</li><li>It can disrupt the socializing importance for children. And the education literature is clear that this alignment approach is less effective for children.</li><li>The buildings</li><li>Do not realign the grades. Montessori is not set up to split grade levels, it is based off older students helping younger students and providing guidance and role models.</li><li>Transportation challenges- having children from one household attending different schools with potentially differing start and dismissal times. Not only does this present a challenge for self transportation, but with bus transportation as well. Bus transportation has been inadequate over the past two years and children residing in proximity to the school have been encouraged to walk. No issue with that, however, if they’re reassigned to another school a distance away (I.e. grade 6-8), younger siblings will walk and older ones will have to be transported. This certainly presents a challenge to those families lacking adequate resources inclusive of childcare, transportation, etc…</li><li>Since a significant proportion of children attending IPS are lacking in resources, I find it concerning that this issue wasn’t taken into consideration prior to presenting this proposal. If it was, then it deliberately ignored in my opinion.</li><li>You will create bigger classes in the same size school. That never seems to lead to better results.</li><li>Change.</li><li>Would lack consistency for my child - really wanted same school for 9 years</li><li>The transition: What is a considerate way to transition a current K-8 to a K-5 when there are kids who were counting on being there until high school? If 91 is transitioned before my children finish there, we will likely leave IPS altogether and go to Washington Township &amp;/or Herron Prep.</li><li>Fewer opportunities for older children to mentor, more transitions, Difficult for parents with multiple children, mixing kids from different schools at a developmentally challenging time</li><li>I feel getting parents on board as well as staff may be a challenge at first as they could be resistant to the new changes. I feel if we give enough time and information the transition will be smooth and successful.</li><li>Too many people in the schools</li><li>there should not be. let's make it happen</li><li>Community buy-in.</li><li>Losing community, discipline struggles, busing, kids falling trough the cracks in a large school</li><li>Younger children expose to older children behavior and might try to replicate their behavior.</li><li>One huge benefit for kids in a K-8 model is the small middle school size which would be lost in the move to middle school buildings. Unlike a more traditional school they have the same teachers 6th-8th for core classes which allows for great relationship building. Relationships are key in education. Students who have good relationships with their teacher do learn better. In a larger 6-8 middle school kids can start to become a number and not a person.</li><li>In my opinion IPS can’t successfully replicate successful programs AND reconfigure grades. They need to pick one or the other and focus in on that plan and making that plan work. They also need to realize that, in most cases, the successful programs are also the ones not using the district curriculum. It’s less about the “label” (Reggioinspired; CFI/IB; Montessori) and more about being responsive to the students we teach and how we teach them.</li><li>The district has been shouting the benefits of a k-8 education for the past several (5+) years. This 180 turn seems to be more about money and less about the education our children receive.</li><li>If you close non-performing buildings and create new opportunities for Choice programs in areas of the city that are not being served, why do you also need to realign the grades? It seems you would be changing what we know to work (smaller class sizes in k8 buildings around a central model) to fit more kids into smaller schools and make very large MS.</li><li>Middle school is such a tough age that the continuity and small grade size in the current format is a major draw that has major positive impact on kids through this difficult age. I doubt we would continue with IPS for middle school if it makes this change.</li><li>I cannot think of one negative of separate middle school.</li><li>Age differences</li><li>Most (all?) of the "high performing schools" mentioned above are K-8. One idea is to expand these programs; however, if we realign the grades, we are dismantling those same programs. I have not heard or seen anything that suggests how those models work with the middle school grades. It feels a lot like we are prioritizing the elementary school kid needs for these programs at the expense of the middle school students.</li><li>CFI 79 middle school program is strong so a challenge I see is growing pains and losing a strong program for my children once they get to middle school if IPS makes this switch - why open new buildings and force kids out of well performing schools? Focus on the under performing schools</li><li>For us, it would be a transportation issue to get kids to different schools. It would depend largely on where the schools were located.</li><li>You don’t get the possible mentoring between young and older</li><li>Busing and older students not being able to walk and care for younger siblings. As well as families withdrawing from IPS because they chose their particular school because it was K-8.</li><li>Losing school choice, having to apply again for muddle school, all the progression from the program lost.</li><li>The impact it will have on all the K-8 schools and families - this will be especially tough on students who are just getting back to more normalcy after a pandemic. I think pushing kids into different buildings could be detrimental emotionally. Our kids have been through enough these last few years; let’s try to keep as much normalcy as we can for them.</li><li>Pulling kids out of a school they have been affiliated with for purely political reasons, i.e. clearly targeting a so-called “privileged” school. I’d call that a “challenge”.</li><li>Split communities</li><li>Loss of routines and structure. Children thrive on set routines, and middle school years are critical when it comes to supporting the development of confident and secure individuals. Realigning the grades may also lead to the onset of social challenges that would be triggered by a set of factors in this new structure including changed learning formats and strained relationships.</li><li>siblings in different schools, different location hard on families</li><li>While it is convenient for families to have all children at one school, we feel it is more important to have grade realigning to concentrate on age and grade specific concentrations in their respective cluster.</li><li>We love our school and very much want to stay in it through grade 8</li><li>We love our school and very much want to stay in it through grade 8</li><li>The most devastating challenge with realigning, (bunching), grade levels is the inappropriate mixing of 6th graders with junior high students as well as 9th graders with high school students.</li><li>Buildings and Locations.</li><li>When do you choose to phase it out and can a 7th grade class remain at their school for the final year. Location for the middle school.</li><li>Lots of families are very worried that the schools we have chosen for our students will cease to exist. We deliberately chose IPS and our magnet school for the continuity our twice exceptional student would receive from elementary through middle school at Sidener where students need extra support and academic challenge. We don't want to leave our school, and I know many other families do not want to leave their schools either. Unfortunately, I've already heard rumblings from many families that they will finally make the move to private schools or townships or leave the city altogether and move the suburbs if this happens. We know students leave IPS in droves for high school, so this change will likely cause privileged families to make the move at middle school instead or never choose IPS in the first place. This saddens me greatly because we love the city and our school. We want all of our city's schools to be great for all of our kids, but that will be very hard to do with we lose even more students to other districts or private schools.</li><li>Transportation would be the only challenge, however, I am confident that the district can create a plan that supports all families, students, and staff and roll this out smoothly for all.</li><li>The only realigning I favor is changing K-8 buildings to K-6.</li><li>Physical building might not work</li><li>Nothing. I think it should have always stayed the way it was. There is no reason why we need a school for just 6th graders. Or the same for the just 7 &amp; 8th grades.</li><li>Fewer students at the elementary school that are already having issues with lower enrollment.</li><li>The first year will pose challenges of shifting they way parents think.</li><li>Travel logistics for families</li><li>not sure</li><li>More buses</li><li>School hours changing</li><li>I really can't think of one.</li><li>It is amazing the way that it is.</li><li>Where are the 6-8th graders going to be housed/</li><li>Breaking up the proven K-8 schools just to align with surrounding districts would be one of the worst decisions that IPS has made. Please take a look at schools in IPS that are successful and dig deep to see why. Is it the educational model (Montessori, Butler Lab, language or arts focus) or grade configuration? Putting more resources toward replicating what works would be a much better solution than upending those higherperforming schools.</li><li>I don’t think the 6-8 model helps develop relationships. Why would we put all those students dealing with so much all together with new people, new staff, no connection when they need so much connection? Show me the research that shows it works in larger urban systems.</li><li>Parents having to drop off in multiple locations</li><li>Transportation is already a barrier for many neighborhood school families who fall within the "walk/drive" area. Splitting grades will make more challenges for families who may need to transport students to multiple buildings. We are currently bussing students across the city to choice schools, while there are families who are within the "walk/drive" zone who cannot get to school safely or easily. Young children are not able to walk to school alone, and the infrastructure around many schools is not safe for students walking or biking along high traffic roads. I worry access will become harder when students are required to travel further, and families split between multiple buildings.</li><li>I don’t see one. Most school districts Separate out middle school and junior high’s.</li><li>Parent/Staff by in, and transportation.</li><li>Funds to adequately create functional spaces in close proximity for existing students.</li><li>We chose to apply out of district specifically for the Montessori program and the fact it would carry through 8th grade. I think those three schools in particular would benefit more from being able to continue their model, or at least a Montessori middle school be designed.</li><li>Innovation schools, like Montessori, empower children by allowing younger children to learn from older children. For example, our middle schoolers are closer as peers to the 4/5th grade community and often will work with these individuals to help them with curriculum, music, etc. This empowers the MS age kids to share their knowledge but also appreciate their ability to contribute to the society. Montessori curriculum uses multi age level classes based on benefits reported in several research studies. Further, peer teaching and support is absolutely critical for child development and builds strong bonds that adult/child relationships may not be able to fill.</li><li>You will move great teachers from buildings and schools where they have developed relationships with the incoming students, parents, and community at large. You will remove the possibility of the younger children being able to learn from the older children. You will take from the older children the ability to assume leadership positions and a sense of growth and accomplishment. You will put the older children in positions of uncertainty and wariness, when they should be feeling their strongest, most capable selves. You will be taking the middle schoolers from their places of comfort and stability during a time when their hormones are unstable and they are most uncomfortable with their bodies. It doesn’t make any sense. You remember middle school, right?</li><li>?</li><li>It makes transportation harder for families with kids in different grades, which is a strain on poorer families in particular</li><li>Putting 6th graders with 7 and 8 could be hard on the 6th graders.</li><li>The challenges with realigning grades far outweigh the benefits. Challenges include (i) losing the strong sense of community that is evident under the current IPS structure, (ii) no longer facilitating the ability for older students to mentor/teach younger students, and (iii) for parents with multiple young children, realigning into K-5, 6-8 would make things more difficult as parents need to manage kids at multiple IPS schools. In short, the current IPS structure works well overall and my fear is that realigning grades will result in IPS taking an unnecessary step backwards.</li><li>Building space for middle schools and the cost of maintaining buildings</li><li>Again, this is a BAD idea. Middle school is so difficult. The current K-8 model at 91 and other magnets works. The students have grown up together and are part of community. They are therefore more supportive of one another and you therefore skip many of the middle school nightmares - fights, bullying, drugs, etc. Our youngest of 6 is entering 6th grade at 91. We do not want him at a traditional middle school. Please don't try to fix what isn't broken.</li><li>Student teacher relationships</li><li>Loosing student teacher relationship</li><li>Families like the idea of their child attending one school prior to high school. Typically all siblings are in the same building.</li><li>Transportation costs will seemingly go up. Right now a family that rides 2 different buses may be moved to needing 3 separate bus pick-ups at that address. 2) If you mix charter/lottery and regular schools in middle school, kids who are behind due to the different curriculum at the regular schools are going to slow down learning for the charter school kids, which is not fair to them. Leveling at the middle school level would be crucial.</li><li>Our family is excited about the pk-8 model at Montessori 91, and how a smaller middle school could benefit our kids. I worry about a larger middle school meaning fewer chances for the arts and a closer knit community. Please keep the arts available to all students.</li><li>In the past IPS incorporated community schools serving grades 7-12. Parents felt their 7th and 8th graders were not ready to be in a high school setting. We expanded our K-6 to K-8. At that time, parents felt the middle school children were too old to be in an elementary setting. Also, transportation was an issue. Some schools experienced more discipline issues than others. In our community schools, I recall an issue with middle school test assessments lower than high school.</li><li>Transition from current configuration and disrupting successful schools seems to be a challenge. K-8 seems to be working well in several schools. Also schools that have been stable and successful as K-6 would be disrupted. Having everyone do the same does not equal success. The schools that are innovating and building on those innovations will not be able to focus on pedagogical success and building within and going onto the next steps because of the configuration disruption which does not have a track record of in and of itself of bettering schools. The IPS choice schools are incubators for success and anything that will take away from their models and their concept fidelity, such as this grade reconfiguration, is not worth the disruption in my opinion.</li><li>more/extra work moving 6th graders into middle school</li><li>maybe funds</li><li>building with too many students. A campus of 1,000 middle schoolers would not be successful I believe. You would need additional arts and foreign language teachers for these campuses, which are challenging to find. Setting up libraries in each building would also be challenging. Would you take books from existing K-8 schools and send them to new middle schools? Would additional funds be made available to set up high quality libraries in each building? Any IB campus would need a certified librarian at least half time per the IB requirements.</li><li>I think that 6th graders should not be in with all 7th and 8th graders. 6th graders need that last in elementary year to prepare for muddle school. They are not ready emotionally or psychological to handle the true middle school experience. There are plenty of 6th graders who are only 11 years old and plenty of 8th graders that are already or almost 15. There is a lot of difference between these age groups. Putting 6th graders in such close contact with 8th graders causes 6th graders to face older types of peer pressure.</li><li>I strongly prefer the K-8 model that cold spring has. It allows the students to maintain strong relationships with staff members including the “specials” teachers and admin staff in a close knit community over many years. Especially during the transition into junior high years, this presents many benefits for these children. I will be disappointed if that option is removed</li><li>Some of the choice programs, like the Montessori programs, would have a difficult time in the transition as they use mixed age classrooms. Mixed age classrooms benefit the children because the older kids help the younger kids and it teaches them empathy and responsibility.</li><li>It will lead to larger schools and the possible elimination of special schools like high ability due to the lower enrollment at such schools.</li><li>They would lose the benefit of their current programing (i.e. Montessori) and some children are not prepared for middle school emotionally, mentally.</li><li>I do not believe there would be any challenges for the parents and students.</li><li>Probably one of the challenges would be adults adapting such as some faculty and some family members.</li><li>Transportation</li><li>Timeline for doing so. When will this be implemented. Also, transportation to multiple schools for parents with two or more children.</li><li>Students lose their friends in other grades, siblings would be split up going to different schools at an earlier age. Students would lose the support of past teachers and administrators they are comfortable with and who know the student's history. It is traumatic at the 9th grade level and would be even more so at the 6th grade level.</li><li>Requires more resources, where resources could be shared between many grade levels.</li><li>"I would like to see the educational models from elementary school maintained… or like schools grouped. Lab Schools + CFI in 1 middle school for example.</li><li>There are MANY parents that believe K-8 schools allow their children to avoid the bullying and mental health challenges of middle school, IPS will need to be proactive about this belief and/or reality.</li><li>Larger middle schools are not a good solution.</li><li>Younger siblings is not attending school with older siblings; safety walking to school</li><li>How are you going to replicate the highly successful special choice programs like Montessori and CFI in middle school? The opportunity for these programs during K-8 is one of the main reasons we chose IPS.</li><li>It typically takes 5-7 years to gain fluency in a language so changing from k-6 to k-5 would take away a year from fluency.</li><li>Multiple students from one family at different locations.</li><li>Younger siblings is not attending school with older siblings; safety walking to school</li><li>You lose the community feel of the school. The beauty of K-8 is that as a new parent, you are alongside parents who have been there for nine years or more who know the good, bad, and in between - and can give you a sense of context when things are challenging. Students feel strong connections to their teachers and their administrators.. you throw that out the window if you re-align the grades… I can’t imagine how you state you’re going to replicate successful schools and start by throwing out one of the key ingredients of their success.</li><li>Lose the biggest benefit to IPS - combined K-8</li><li>Leaving the safety and security of a k-5 system at an elevated emotional time would be hard for all kids. Teachers and team members get to know kiddos in elementary school. Keeping that stability as kids become tweens and teens is beneficial to everyone in the IPS family.</li><li>I work in a neighboring township and many students don't look forward to middle school, so replicating that isn't something I'm looking for. I chose IPS because of the k-8 model and will likely leave if that model does.</li><li>Scheduling and transportation timing for children in same household</li><li>Where are the resources for these buildings and staffing coming from? Our building is in need of repairs and has no secure vestibule. Yet is a thriving program. Ensure the safety of your current schools before over promising and under delivering.</li><li>transportation and distance</li><li>Makes life harder for working parents with multiple children. Means that children have to go through the stress of switching school multiple times for no reason.</li><li>Rehiring students and organizing separate classroom space for nes grade splits.</li><li>Space, buildings in the city?</li><li>Loss of consistency, community, support and the mental health/well-being of our students.</li><li>Many of the choice schools have specific focuses ( IB, Reggio, Montessori,etc). Will the middle school offerings align with these focuses that are continuing to “work” each year?</li><li>Will class sizes remain smaller? These choice programs work due to their smaller class sizes and community/neighborhood school feel.</li><li>Where will you put the middle schoolers? How will you continue IB programming?</li><li>Differing school proximity for siblings in grade and middle schools</li><li>One of the things I was most excited about moving to the district recently was the stability of the community we were joining. We were excited for the k-8 model and the longevity that would provide. Also, our daughter will be attending Sidener. We are very concerned about what this change would mean for the high ability environment.</li><li>Could lead to closing existing schools due to the loss of a lot of their students &amp; staff.</li><li>Having K-8 schools is practical for families and developmentally advantageous for kids. Families with multiple children cannot fully invest themselves in multiple schools. It puts families in the hard position of trying to decide where to invest their support and resources. Families and schools will both feel the strain. Kids will also miss out on the culture of these schools. Having the middle school and elementary grades together allows for more confidence and security as they grow. It fosters community and mentorship.</li><li>You will lose high touch programs that meaningfully impact students lives at a vulnerable time. You will lose dedicated teachers and all families with means to send their kids out of district</li><li>Takes our children in school specific programs out of them earlier than we were wanting</li><li>Possibly Transportation issues and timeframes of how long it will take to implement these plans</li><li>Those that have realigned their housing, jobs, and lives to be centered around their children's school will inevitably have to face future barriers when their children get to the age to transition to another school (earlier than expected). Those with multiple children now at two different schools will face transportation barriers for parents. As a single parent who works and also goes to school full time, getting my young children to school on a daily basis is a constant chaotic battle. Trying to navigate two schools with potential different start times, and school events will be another obstruction to success for us. I am one person, and bus transportation has been unreliable in the past.</li><li>It feels as though it's an unnecessary transition that will also provide unnecessary stressors on the children getting acclimated to new schools. If there are new schools with different children, this increases the likelihood of adversary childhood experiences with bullying, low self esteem, and unnecessary anxiety/potential depression.</li><li>It took me 4 years to get my kids into 91. Please don't make us leave the building. There are better ways to revitalize the structure of IPS.</li><li>IPs Middle schools have not historically been successful</li><li>The stability of being with peers from k-8</li><li>It’s different :)</li><li>Siblings at different schools- scheduling issues including transportation</li><li>More transitions from elementary to middle school (rather than k-8).</li><li>Change</li><li>Already difficult time staffing, and where would these separate middle schools be?</li><li>Families are invested in our K-8 schools. I, personally, don’t want to see the change. We don’t want to do the lottery process again either. What would it take to get a placement in a new 6-8 school?</li><li>The loss of sending my kids to a smaller neighborhood school. Part of the appeal of sending our kids to #57 is the fact it is K-8. The teachers really get to know each kid, especially at the Middle School level. My shy 7th grader is not just a name on a seating chart lost in the shuffle of larger, shifting classes.</li><li>Changing schools</li><li>I imagine it could be very logistically difficult to make this realignment a reality. To change the landscape of schools to accommodate new and different groups of kids could be tough. Not to say it's not worth doing if we know the advantages, but if they are nebulous and only backed by flimsy opinions like the one I gave above, might not actually be worth it.</li><li>9th grade students are very young to be in the same school at 12th graders and could be problematic.</li><li>Risk in discontinuity potential in programs such as IB</li><li>I would like my kids to be in CFI-84 K-8. We choose this school so our kids are not bused around the town to get to school. We like the small community.</li><li>How would that look for high performing/high demand schools? Would all CFI schools have one middle school? Butler Lab? Montessori? etc.? If students, parents and families are not aligned with the philosophy and vision of the school that change may have a negative impact and you may drive families away from IPS. When would this start? My son is in 7th grade this year at a K-8 school and want to know where he will be his last year before HS. What options are provided to buildings and families?</li><li>my kids won't all be in same school. younger kids won't have older kids to look up to.</li><li>many elementary schools have excellent middle school programs that would disappear</li><li>IPS has so many choice schools with different curriculums. How do you consolidate those middle schools? A middle school for each curriculum?</li><li>Huge changes are always a risk. But maybe in normal years these high performing schools could weather the changes- but I (a single mom with a Hispanic child fwiw) worked hard to get into a CFI school and they seem to be truly struggling right now. A lot of the things that made them unique (like the removal of desks and great teachers and subs) have either not been brought back in yet OR there is an extreme shortage of. You can sense the fatigue in the staff and I think changing the model right for those schools that are trying to come back form the covid storm could tank the few high performing schools that we have. Again, I sincerely think huge shifts like moving kids out of the older grade years would be the final straw and performance would drop abruptly.</li><li>IPS lacks the ability to adequately support the number of schools now (athletic facilities, transportation, field trips, etc) and splitting out middle schools will only exacerbate that issue. There are many other challenges that will only result in IPS becoming less attractive to families.</li><li>I think there are MANY challenges in changing up how choice school teaching methods are organized, but one of the most difficult challenges for parents will be having children at multiple schools with VERY POOR transportation options. The IPS bus service has been spotty and unreliable for many years, and after-school programs regularly fill up at the start of the school year. Why do you want to add an additional burden on parents while at the same time taking away their CHOICE to send their kids to the same (or different) schools?!</li><li>You have models that work in Montessori in CFI why would you want to change that adapt your other programs to what already works splitting like everyone else does not work</li><li>I feel this was done before and it failed, so things were reconfigured as they are now. Please take care to make sure we don't just repeat mistakes of the past.</li><li>There are studies showing that whenever there's a transition, scores drop and there's a deficit. I think it's also really good for our 8th graders to share space with Kindergarten.</li><li>One of the reasons the high-demand programs are so popular is because they are K-8. Realigning the grades removes that benefit and all that comes with it for both middle and elementary programs (smaller class sizes, personalized attention, stability, community building, to name a few) and introduces another point of transition and uncertainty for students and families. Combining this with the proposed rezoning (and I support the rezoning in theory) will dismantle school communities in a way that may take years to stabilize.</li><li>Everything</li><li>Students who are in a K-8 school and have planned/want to stay enrolled there until end of 8th grade- this would be very hard</li><li>You are taking students out of a familiar setting and education format that was set up from Kindergarten. Moving students from a specific program to a middle school at the end of their K-8 experience is not what parents enrolled for at IPS. I believe like so many if the new format happens you will lose a large population of students in choice schools to private schools or different school districts.</li><li>You’re going to get a lot of privileged parents fighting this simply because they don’t want to have to go through a middle school “process.” I think this could be mitigated some with feeder middle schools but ultimately you’ll still have a vocal minority yelling about it. I’m super open to the idea of reconfiguring if we can actually articulate the benefits and I can understand the benefit to the students at large, even if I’d prefer something different for my own student.</li><li>I think the younger kids benefit from seeing the older kids in their schools. The montessori method is built upon community learning and it would be reduced by realigning the grades.</li><li>Individuals with relocation issues.</li><li>The idea that you'd like to isolate children during one of their most crucial developmental stages. It is working, I don't understand why anyone would propose to change something that isn't broken</li><li>There is no clear plan for maintaining continuity for the currently high performing K-8 schools when they are split into two separate schools.</li><li>Transitioning between schools</li><li>Realigning grades would mean that students and families lose the benefits that K-8 schools offer such as: o Students and families in K-8 schools have longer to build relationships with the school community and staff. This can improve trust and in turn improve the overall experience students have with the school, their willingness to stay (and not transfer out of district) and their academic outcomes o Students are able to grow and become leaders, examples to younger students, see roles that they can mature into o The change to secondary education comes later when students are in a different social/emotional stage of development and could be more prepared for the transition o Continuation of educational philosophy/method could be easier when the continuation from K to 8 is already there</li><li>Questions about potential challenges of reorganizing:</li><li>-Will the choice programs still be able to continue into middle school? What does it take (financially, logistically, adequate buildings) to have a Montessori middle school, a CFI middle school, a Butler Lab middle school and so on?</li><li>-This is a huge transition for middle school teachers and staff who have been well established in their K-8 communities for many years. This is potentially a huge hiring/staffing challenge as new administration will be needed and possibly new teachers and staff. would be needed (if current middle school staff choose to not stay)"</li><li>Multiple kids may be different drop off locations and schedule.</li><li>I don’t know - this is already what we experience and frankly it’s irritating so many other kids get to continue through 8th and ours don’t - seems we would continuity in an immersion program even more so than others.</li><li>I don't think anything needs to change. Both of my students are honor roll kids</li><li>Teachers do not have the ability to monitor problem students proactively when they are in a new building.</li><li>Families in high performing schools will leave the district just as happened with Shortridge when Broadripple closed. Our school used to have half of the graduates go to Shortridge and this year there were none.</li><li>IPS has made too many changes (school radius, start times, school closures, school calendar) in a short period of time. Schools are successful because of stability and neighborhoods/families valuing education.</li><li>Changing to align with outside districts would make it easier for people to leave the district for middle school.</li><li>Overall, there are many more negatives to this proposal than there are benefits.</li><li>I think there will be many challenges with the structuring the grades in IPS. For example, kids may not be able to continue in their choice schools depending on the lottery results. Also equity issues, will there be a middle schools in all communities? what schools will be closed that will lead to inequity? Again, I do not understand why the theme of the survey went from increasing the equity to what schools should be replicated and how difficult it will be to restructure the grades. I think the biggest challenge would be how the restructuring will affect inequity in the district.</li><li>Based on being a parents of a child attending a K-8th school currently, my child has gained a lot from the older (middle school) kids - by partnering younger children with older (for example book buddies) it gave my child an older mentor and connection to the school. At our current school there is a great community and leadership set by the middle school.</li><li>The IPS stand-alone middle schools as is are some of the worst performing schools in the state on ILEARN. How would schools be set up better for success?</li><li>Research clearly states removing 6th grade from K-6 and transitioning K-8 to 6-8 will harm students. This aspect of the proposal is a terrible idea. o Research does not support removing 6th grade from a K-6 model in favor of a middle school (6-8) model. ▪ Increased citations for discipline infractions. Sixth grade students attending middle schools are much more likely to be cited for discipline problems than those attending elementary school. That difference remains after adjusting for the socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of the students and their schools. ▪ Increased discipline citations persist through the following years. The higher infraction rates recorded by sixth graders who are placed in middle school persist at least through ninth grade. ▪ Decreased on-time high school completion. The impact of removing the 6th grade from an elementary program, K-6, and moving it to a middle school, 6-8, decreases on-time high school completion by approximately 1-3 percent. o Research does support dismantling the current K-8 model in favor of a middle school (6-8) model. ▪ Significant drops in academic achievement for both math and English. ▪ Significant drops in academic achievement are similar for boys and girls, but stronger for students with low levels of initial achievement. ▪ Academic achievement drop during the transition year persists through grade 10. ▪ Middle school entry increases student absences. ▪ Middle school entry is associated with higher grade 10 dropout rates. ▪ Little evidence placing public school students into middle schools during adolescence is cost-effective. ▪ Bottom Dog experiences are better for K-8 students. Top dog/bottom dog phenomenon, states that students at the top of a grade span (“top dogs”) have better experiences than those at the bottom (“bottom dogs”) regarding bullying, safety, belonging, and academic achievement. The students who transferred into a K-8 school in sixth grade still had better experiences than students who started at a 6-8 school. ▪ Success of students in K-8 models not due to resources, such as per-pupil expenditures or class size. o Research authors vocalize K-8 support in articles promoting their work. ▪ In their article on their research, The Middle School Plunge: Achievement tumbles when young students change schools, researchers Guido and West write, “Our findings clearly support ongoing efforts in urban school districts to convert stand-alone elementary and middle schools into schools with K-8 configurations…[P]olicymakers should exercise caution before extending the middle-school experiment to school districts that still enjoy the K-8 configuration.” ▪ In their article, “Stuck in the Middle: How and why middle schools harm student achievement,” based on their research, authors Lockwood and Rockoff state that throughout the middle school years, students fall further behind and score below what would be expected if they’d gone to a K-8 school. They end their article, “Of course, it is possible that transitioning to high school could be more difficult for students who come from K-8 schools than for middle school students. If K-8 students experience a larger drop in achievement upon entering high school, that could bring the two groups of adolescents back into parity. But it is hard to recommend closing the middle-school achievement gap by bringing everybody down. The better option is to address the trouble with middle schools – or do away with them altogether. ▪ "There are, no doubt, many highly effective middle schools and many ineffective K–8 schools," [Martin West] says. "Our evidence suggests that, on average, students do worse academically when they attend middle schools than when they attend K–8 schools — and that this is true in urban, suburban, and rural settings.” Footnotes with citations did carry over:Cook, Philip J., MacCoun, Robert, Muschkin, Clara &amp; Vigdor, Jacob. 2006.

Magazine. https://www.gse.harvard.edu/news/ed/12/09/do-middleschools-make-sense</li><li>Kids being removed from their established social and classroom structure. Forcing families to make last-minute decisions about new middle-school only options, after they selected schools where they thought their kids could be through 8th grade. Student attrition because families will opt for charters or private schools instead of newly configured middle schools that they feel are too large, with no understanding of the culture of those new schools (I had a parent from another school tell me point-blank if his kid's school goes to 1-5, he will pull him and send him to Oaks). We rather saw that happen when the high schools were consolidated.</li><li>There are some schools that the model is working well in. For those schools and their design, why change something that is working for them just to align with everyone else? This should be specific to each school and their overall individual performance and needs, not district wide.</li><li>Student retention</li><li>Losing benefits to keeping schools smaller such as quality of programming</li><li>Leave them the way they are.</li><li>Not enough schools to do that or kids will be really far apart, example like one kid in elementary and another kid in middle and the schools are not close to each other so drop off and pick up could be challenging.</li><li>None . Most schools are k-5</li><li>using these models as guides for successful programming and your reasoning for recreating them, then dismantling them and what makes them successful is a challenge. Separating families that rely on their older children to get their younger children to school because ips took away transportation for some families is a challenge. Taking apart teacher and parent communities that have been built for years and are dependent on the longevity of parents being a part of the school and program is a challenge. Way more challenges then benefits in my opinion.</li><li>Have k-8 in the same building allows for much more social/emotional learning than separating those grades</li><li>There are many. What makes magnet program successful now is that with a K-8 model, families are able to invest in the school and relationships knowing they will be there for 9 (even 10) years. Without that structure, there isn’t incentive to invest in building of community. You’re not replicated successful models if you’re destroying what makes them successful. Also, increased bullying at the middle school level.</li><li>Parents who have multiple kids like that their children can be at the same school (i.e. grades k-8). So I would leave this the way it is.</li><li>It will be a years long change.</li><li>There are many challenges that will be at place here, but the largest one is that our children will be Guinea pigs in a plan that failed many years ago, and is trying to be quickly revamped and put into place. The k-8 model that we have currently promotes a safe space for children to learn in smaller class sizes. It offers more parent/family involvement since families often have multiple students in the same building at once. Our kids walk to school and do not have transportation. The older children are responsible for walking the younger children to and from school because of two full time working parents. Forcing children to leave their beloved schools after 5th grade breaks down our community. I will be really honest, I worked in HSE as a 4th grade teacher and I did NOT want my kids to be in a system like that. That’s why we moved to IPS. The k-8 platform is the best way to meet all learners; it promotes risk taking and cultivates better learning because students are in a safe, familiar place with teachers they have known for many years. Thanks for listening.</li><li>Disintegrating the school community built on lasting relationships and continuity in smaller class sizes and number of classes per grade which is better for students and teachers</li><li>Sounds like it would make districting more difficult.</li><li>The k-8 model allows kids continuity through their most important years. I am against creating 6-8 schools.</li><li>Middle school students transition at a time that is already difficult for child development and learning.</li><li>Some of the above programs require k-12 curriculum, better addressed in buildings of k8</li><li>Many of the k-8 schools build community. The kids at these schools have the same elective teachers all 8 years; they have all of their former teachers in the same building to continue to support them. We understand children need social supports—why would you even consider making them feel more isolated in middle school, one of the most difficult times in their lives?</li><li>Specifically, as a Montessori parent, removing students at a critical point in their education (6th grade) would disrupt the extended learning and growth they receive through this methodology prior to entering a traditional high school. Would IPS consider a Montessori middle school? Essentially the program is being destroyed, not “expanded” if you don’t have the follow through of keeping the students k-8 or creating a middle school that would house this philosophy. I due believe it should be offered to more families that are interested. However, it’s difficult for students to drop into this program at any age beyond 2nd grade without a Montessori background. Therefore, growing the program from the lower elementary grades seems suitable so long as the classroom size doesn’t become overwhelming to our teachers and dilute the small group learning approach. Perhaps the increased enrollment of the lower elementary will provide a strong “feeder” pathway to a Montessori middle school. I realize IPS has to look beyond this specific segment of schools. Nonetheless, providing a clear “track” for the students is what will allow this program to grow sustainably with the support of parents.</li><li>The deterioration of the current programing in that the K-8 structure is key to it.</li><li>The students will have to transition buildings two times in approximately 2 years. One of the reasons we chose our current school is that it goes from PreK-8</li><li>I feel very strongly that the current k-8 pattern should continue because it keeps middle school kids in an environment where they are not isolated during a very difficult transition phase in their lives. We have an only child but I also think keeping k-8 together is important for families with more than one child because it reduces the number of schools families have to drop off/pick up at each day and keeps siblings together longer where they can look out for each other. Please keep k-8 together.</li><li>Breaking up the learning communities that have been built over years at the existing schools.</li><li>Many parents who like k-8 are going to be upset</li><li>Will there be enough buses</li><li>We do not want to realign the grades. School #91 is a very diverse, A rated k-8 school where everyone is happy. Why mess with a system that works?</li><li>What historical success has IPS seen with a 6-8 model?</li><li>We stayed at the lab school because we live the idea of keeping middle school small and our kids having access to teachers and relationships they’ve been nurturing since kindergarten</li><li>Potential longer distance to get to the school. This might create unforeseen challenges for some people. Unproductive time in transit to school.</li><li>Children usually in the six grade wouldn't have to be on the bus stop . Where the bus pick up time is 6am. Not fair</li><li>Expectations build different anxieties</li><li>Expectations build different anxieties</li><li>Have you been in an IPS middle school classroom? Have you sat thru every class and stood in the halls during class change? I have, I volunteered prior to the pandemic. It's crazy. The challenges that a middle schooler deals with is exacerbated with the cognitive and physical changes that are taking place. Middle school teachers need to be able to help these kids acclimate and adjust over the three year period. Taking 60 kids from each k-8 school and putting 600 of them into one school, where they don't know the teachers, and the teachers don't know them, is not only difficult from an educational standpoint, but how do you scale the support that is needed to provide a safe and successful environment?</li><li>You talk about equity for 'other' schools, but how can opening up more classrooms in four-five schools on the Northside, help a kid who lives at 38th and Moeller? That is a long drive everyday for a kid on a bus. Why don't you invest the money to these 'other' schools and help them to plan and practice the same programs that the higherperforming schools have - Invest in the curriculum. Invest in the schools as they sit now, don't move kids, teachers, and problems to new places. IPS tried this approach 30 years ago and it didn't work then. It won't work now because honestly, IPS doesn't have the money or the manpower to support these kids. We want all kids to have an equitable education, but changing everything that these kids have known for the last six years, at such a crucial time, is unfair to them. Give these kids what they need; give them stability and community. And ask yourself, do I want my middle schooler to be in with 600 people they don't know? To be with people that don't know them at all? Or do I want the teacher that has seen them grow up over the last six years to be part of their lives.</li><li>middle school disasters; losing kids to pvt and out of county</li><li>Students perform better in K-8 schools. Transitions are minimized, Families are able to stay together longer and me involved in the same school together in a more cohesive fashion. Adolescents are challenged to become leaders and model growth at a time when they could default to floundering and uneasiness instead.</li><li>IPS does not currently have a group of high-performing, highly-sought-after 6-8 schools to replicate so it would be ending all of the programs that are currently demonstrating success and high-interest for families in the K-8s to experimentally build more 6-8s. As a parent and an educator, I know that there is data to support both K-5s/6-8s and K-8s. Personally, our family intentionally chose a school that has a K-8 because of the many inherent challenges that already exist with the middle-grade years. As we navigate social media and mental health, K-8s allow students to remain supported in safe, known communities and to finish out their early/middle grades education in the same model. I am aware of schools who have added grades 6-8 recently due to family demand to "please let our students stay at this school!". It is heart-wrenching and upsetting to picture all K-8s having to end after 5th grade to send students to unproven new 6-8s.</li><li>We selected IPS bc it provided the option to send our kids to the same school for 8 years. The current alignment has worked so well in making IPS an option over private schools w it’s option to send kids to K-8 schools. Realignment will definitely make us and many other families reconsider options as we have kids kindergarten-middle school and would like to keep them in the same school. This gives a sense of identity, consistency, and safety.</li><li>Please see answers above</li><li>I think putting 6th grade in middle school is to early, they need that extra year of elementary</li><li>Current schools would lose 6th grade students and staff associated with that grade level. For Theodore Potter, this would be very difficult, and a strong commitment to maintaining dual language in 6th-8th would have to be upheld by IPS.</li><li>Just one? Where do you find the teaching staff when many middle grade teachers in k-8 buildings don’t hold licenses for one subject, but general Ed 6-8. Where do you find special area teachers for the new 6-8 buildings because the special teachers may choose to stay with their current school? When you look at test scores (and we all know kids are more than that, right?) do you see greater success at large middle schools or is it better in the magnet/choice k-8 schools where kids have been for their entire education? Do you see a lot of transient students in the choice program middle grades? How many more classrooms could actually be added successfully in the current k-8 buildings by taking out a few classes? What does transportation look like? We already have buses that struggle to run routes to these schools, so why add in more schools and more routes? Have you considered the loss of student money from the state when kids leave the district at 6th grade instead of the exit issues at 9th grade? Or even, families that will chose to not ever come to the district because they pick schools based on the continuation of a program and school community for the major portion of their children’s academic career? And finally, if we are thinking of the students here, don’t we want them to have an environment where they have seen where they will go when they are little and can also look back at how far they have come when they are big? Don’t we want them to have a community of teachers who have known them and their families for years? Upper grade teachers start knowing kids when they are little and the younger grade teachers follow their education. The community is strong and because of that, the kids are mentally in a better space, with emotional support, academic support, and for many it’s even more than that! Please consider keeping the k-8 communities together. Visit the k-8 schools and see the communities in action!</li><li>Very opposed to this "one size fits all approach" and would likely leave IPS over it. Should be determined on a school-by-school basis. Safety and development of students who choose to stay within a single school would be undermined as relationships with staff and younger/older students would be unnecessarily severed and opportunities to differentiate/accelerate would be precluded. For schools that have built a caring learning community, this would destroy that culture and likely lead to additional behavioral and violence issues. A wholesale realignment is counter to IPS' stated goals of "academic excellence built through individualized, relationship-based learning," "committed to serving individual students with what they need," and "power to create their own future" by removing choices and opportunities. It is quite possible that a blanket realignment will accelerate the departure of families from the IPS district.</li><li>Please see above.</li><li>You'll be disrupting tight knit, local k-8 schools that have thrived and really created an ethos throughout the child's time there: it also would create increased logistic issues for bussing and parents depending on how far away the location of those middle schools should be compared to the choice or neighborhood schools.</li><li>We know that traditional middle school 6-8 models don’t work as well. The K-8 model has both academic and social/emotional gains for kids. I have seen this first hand at our wonderful Montessori school. PLEASE do not dismantle this!</li><li>Switching children out of their k-8 school mid middle school. Should be phased in moving forward and kept with school choice ie CFI, Montessori , traditional etc</li><li>I feel that schools should stay k-8. I like the idea of keeping siblings together. I like the idea of having older kids looking out for younger children. I like having older children in an elementary school as role models for the younger children. I believe that middle schools make our children grow up faster than they need too. Middle school is hard enough. K-8 schools allow children to still be children. K-8 schools seem like more of a community. When you send your children to a school that they will be at for awhile you are making a commitment to that school. You get involved more. My children would have a hard time if IPS schools were to change. They are very happy at their k-8 school. Please make IPS schools stronger by making all K-8 schools the strongest.</li><li>Unnecessary socio-emotional stressors placed upon students and loss of special programming (e.g. Montessori, etc)</li><li>I want to make sure that Sidener Academy is not adversely impacted by this change. Sidener is the entire reason that our students and family moved into the district.</li><li>Kids should be able to finish k-8 in the same school. This disrupts siblings being together.</li><li>There is SUCH a significant developmental leap from 6th-8th grade, I really prefer to keep 6th graders with elementary school. I'd be tempted to pull my special-needs son out of public schools and find a smaller school environment for him.</li><li>Alienating local community and / or changing community involvement for programs that are doing well with k-8 programs.</li><li>Please reconsider! This is not a positive path forward. The mist successful programs in the district are in fact the K-8 schools.</li><li>So many. We will have to look for options outside of IPS if this happens.</li><li>Older children will not receive the benefits of being leaders for younger students, as is important to the Montessori model.</li><li>Realigning the grades would effectively dismantle the most economical (according to the Meeting 5 Small Group handout) model for IPS that is effective. IPS has substantial retention problems from 8th grade to high school. Unless this transition to middle schools was accomplished with efficiency and with the assurances that the quality of education would continue from elementary school to middle school (especially for choice schools), then IPS runs the risk of losing more students to non-IPS private schools. This would result in a spiral of funding loss.</li><li>Loosing students and giving parents of multiple children more challenges to get their students to schools.</li><li>Children don't always move with each other to the next grade level building within IPS like they do in other school districts. For example a student in a township elementary is more likely to have the same peers along with new ones at that township's middle school. At IPS schools they often move to schools in a different area of center township or to a different district when moving to a new graded school. Having schools with K-8 in IPS allows parents who see the importance of continuity of friendships and location to be able to choose those schools. This is one of the main reasons we chose the school we chose. It is currently K-8 and I really hope it stays that way. I'm honestly frustrated that it might not.</li><li>Children who struggle with transition due to mental health issues could struggle with moving into elementary to middle school buildings</li><li>I don't have a specific concern. It would be nice to keep the k-5 and 6-8 near each other because several families have multiple kids in k-8 or k-6 and that could be a big problem for drop off.</li><li>Montessori is too different from traditional education to combine them and force the Montessori kids to change the way they learn to fit the more traditional way of teaching.</li><li>Reduce outcomes for students</li><li>There are many challenges and drawbacks. Don’t do it.</li><li>Kids getting moved around and having to make all new friends and learn how new schools work.. Sidener would not make any sense to do this with either. I really don’t understand how any school would work this way? If I want Herron prep I want it K-8 so why separate it. Same if I want CFI or whatever I don’t want to have to do the lottery for middle school and I don’t want to switch my kids to a whole new location and possibly a new school program as well. For us the k-8 seems like the best fit and one reason we picked the schools we picked please don’t make it harder to go to IPS. Many people move out of IPS district when kids start school…let’s not make it even harder to deal with the ever changing IPS school system.</li><li>I believe K-8 models create a more nurturing learning environment than bouncing the kids to another school for three years then bouncing again to high school. It seems like an unnecessary extra transition. The K-8 schools allow for extra leadership opportunities for the middle schoolers. I also believe it’s important for a large age range of kids to coexist in one building for the benefit of all the kids. It creates normalcy for being around a breadth of different kids, experiences, backgrounds, and ages. I like to think it helps younger kids be less intimidated by older children.</li><li>Larger groups of Middle School students foster larger behavioral issues. Changing school diminishes the sense of belonging or leadership that can be fostered in K-8 model.</li><li>Disrupting school communities; families having children at multiple different schools which will worsen transportation challenges and make it difficult to be fully engaged at all the schools their children attend. As a pediatric/adolescent health professional I also strongly hold that kids learn better in stable environments with faculty and staff that know them well to support them well- adding a school transition adds another point of instability. I am not supportive of this change.</li><li>Property is at a premium and I think money could be better spent raising salaries for teachers and school staff.</li><li>My son is a middle schooler at a K-8 building and is finally a leader in the community. The school has built in important traditions for him to feel this way including opportunities to work with and be a role model for younger students. Middle school is difficult enough without putting all of the angsty students together and teaching them a new structure. In my opinion, it would be a disaster and I would absolutely not keep my son in an IPS school. I am fortunate to be in a position to consider homeschooling as an option. One of the biggest challenges is that you would lose active parents and students. I do not support this transition at all.</li><li>I am a graduate of a IPS middle school. It was extraordinarily rough and it remained rough until we change the model several years back. K-8 makes so much more sense for kids, families, communities, and teachers. Our values must be aligned with stakeholders and not exclusively with bottom lines for a major decision like this. If the interest is in using buildings then just make more K-8 environments not middle schools.</li><li>I implore IPS leadership to grow this model. It was catastrophic when we last had MS programs and families don’t want that again. While I can see how MS programs would be beneficial to students in some ways, if parents don’t feel like the environments are safe or educational, they won’t send them. Our students deserve better. While our family would prefer K-8 programs (there is so much to be said for being in the same building and growing community for 9 years!!), if this is the option given, I would expect IPS to grow their MS programs one grade at a time. Start with 6th the first year, and then add a year each year those students rise until you have 6,7, 8 programs. By doing it this way, I think you’d get buy in from families that are reluctant, students will be able to learn routines/expectations, and you could GROW communities and not just throw them together.</li><li>I know that we need to make tough choices to improve, but I implore IPS to take into consideration what happened in the past, learn from this mistakes, and to have a thoughtful plan of action.</li><li>I also think the district should consider sharing this information with staff in a timely manner, well before they make a district announcement.</li><li>Also, I know the district has been working on this for a year, but families still get the impression that leadership had a plan in mind and would move that plan to fruition regardless of family/community input. I’d like IPS leadership to consider how we as a community could make that not seem so.</li><li>Bussing</li><li>In my experience, K-8 is a much better environment for our kids in almost every way</li><li>I don’t understand why it would be any issues besides maybe having so many select grade levels otherwise I believe this is such a great idea with there being such short staff teachers having similar aged kids in the same building will help so much. Younger kids will always want to be a part of the new move putting so many different ages creates chaos and gives some parents a form of uncertainty of their child's safety and morals.</li><li>I believe more families will choose to leave IPS at the end of 5th grade or choose other k-8 charter/private options to begin with and skip IPS all together.</li><li>Unnecessary and Painful disruption of the children’s environment.</li><li>Loss of community/consistency for students, especially vulnerable populations</li><li>Many challenges. Parents in K-8s have been surveyed many times and desire the K-8 model. Losing k-8 may result in further loss of families in the district. Programs such as CFI build on the framework. An all IB middle school would be needed to funnel the PYP to the MYP.</li><li>Some schools may have a decrease in enrollment due to grades being moved out to other schools.</li><li>I think it invites some stress for students - would rather keep them in familiar surroundings and people thru 8th grade so they can learn to be leaders and have some comfort rather than starting “again” in a new place during a very transitional time of their life.</li><li>All previous models have been tried in the district. I attended Shortridge when it was just 7-8, then for a time it was 6-12. There are so many kids in a building at a crucial developmental stage that it was a lot to manage. What I think will happen, because it happened in the past, is that specialized programs will be introduced back into middle schools (performing arts, math science, humanities, IB, Montessori feeders) and kids that are in those programs will generally do really well compared to the general population of the school. Or there will be middle schools that get all the northside magnet school kids and you will still have huge disparities between middle schools with some over and some under performing. In a high poverty, diverse district like IPS the k-8 model provides the most opportunity for individualized learning and opportunities for all kids-especially because of the smaller middle schools. I also think it is a much better teaching experience for educators and helps retain middle school teachers. The middle school at 91 is a big part of why we chose the school-it is absolutely outstanding. Our kids do well wherever they attend high school. There have been plenty of opportunities at our school for district wide sports, clubs, and music. This is likely because of committed teachers, parents, and admin taking on extra roles. I also reviewed the excel spreadsheet and it seems that most of the k-6 buildings have space to add middle school. It would be incredibly helpful to fund a position for each k-8 that can support just extracurricular activities and sports-this would increase opportunity because the responsibility would not be on another full time teacher. We should use the education foundation to raise the money needed to support the right approachwhich in my opinion and experience is k-8 and 9-12.</li><li>The Montessori model is successful with streamlined K-8 instruction, multi grade classes, and a dedicated building for all grades. Separating the school into K-5 and 6-8 would disrupt a successful instructional model that serves students all the way through to starting high school.</li><li>Lack of or improper attention shown to students who are coping with a disability that need special attention. With the number of students per class we will need to have adjustments made to accommodate a potentially high performing child with special needs.</li><li>Childhood outcomes and consistency is better with a K-8 program</li><li>Disrupting existing programs working</li><li>This would be disruptive for building strong and lasting community, inside the building among the faculty and students, and outside the building with the families. It’s so valuable for The middle school students to see where they have come from as youngsters, and for the youngest students to truly see where they are headed. It goes against Montessori philosophy and the 3 year cycle which is very important to the method will be eliminated at upper elementary level</li><li>(Grades 4-6). Middle school is the perfect time to help Montessori students transition to a slightly more traditional model of instruction and that would be impossible with this proposal. Our Montessori school is only as strong as it is because we have our valuable middle school program within our school. I believe many families would leave IPS knowing this change would happen. They may leave earlier than they are now and send their students to private schools or out of district with this proposed change. One huge draw from families is knowing their students can attend our school from preK through 8th grade. The continuity and longevity is very important to them.</li><li>siblings in separate schools</li><li>For smaller neighborhood IPS schools (like school 57), the K-8 style is the attraction (not challenge) because it fosters diverse grade style learning by keeping larger family kids together longer; brothers and sisters going to school together verses spreading them across 3 schools.</li><li>Keeping the CFI programs for this older lids</li><li>I think it is important for younger kids to see modeled, appropriate behaviors from older children, and older children learn a great deal about patience, filtering, and responding to the younger kids. When done correctly, socioemotional developmental milestones for both groups of children can be reinforced. That said, I don't know that I would consider what I see happening is beneficial for either group. Our experience last year showed acceptance and tolerance of abusive behavior within the same grades. If that isn't addressed, there is no concern for how schools are structured.</li><li>I think middle school was a terrible and tough time, and think if you could stay at the same school until 8th grade it would be easier. I love that schools are K-8 it was a huge draw for us and we love our school.</li><li>Breaking up a school model and culture that already works really well. Specifically the school 91 Montessori model.</li><li>I think it is a POOR decision of IPS Superintendent to choose to dismantle working models that are in existence with IPS. K-8 Montessori works. School 91 is racially and economically diverse with high performing students.</li><li>A challenge is that you are dismantling working models and impacting lives of children and parents who were depending on a k-8, high performing model. My high-performing student will likely be leaving IPS if her current model of learning is dismantled. In addition, these surveys have been gaslighting in nature not really asking for true opinions, but asking questions in a way to get answers you want. The agenda of this administration is clear: You will pretend to get opinions and feedback, but it is quite clear you’ll do whatever you want despite parent and student objections.</li><li>Families will have little faith and trust in stand alone middle schools. In the current k-8 model, parents and guardians have such strong relationships within the school that the tender middle school years feel much less stressful when kids are in the same environment they grew up in. Parents will be devastated if these stand alone middle schools don’t continue on with their choice school curriculum, in our case the Montessori method, and will have a really hard time enrolling their kids in a traditional, large mainstream middle school. You will lose a lot of families who are currently enrolled in Choice schools. For many of these families, the choice was never between a Choice IPS school and another IPS option. The choice was between a Choice IPS school or private school or a school in another district.</li><li>Adding just an extra and unnecessary transition for students who are already currently thriving in the K-8 model.</li><li>Not involved with public schools</li><li>Addressing students' developmental stage…</li><li>Separating siblings earlier and creating increased logistical issues for parents.</li><li>Finding qualified staff and stable schools</li><li>I can’t narrow it to just one. The loss of community, the loss of 6-8 students mentoring elementary students and elementary students striving to reach goals set by the 6-8 students, lack of family connection/interaction with the school because it is further from home, the loss of challenge for students working at/above grade level because teacher/school focus will be on those working to reach grade level. We left a great school (CFI27) because they simply couldn’t provide adequate challenge (especially in 6- 8 grades) for high ability students. My guess is that a change like this will mean many students will simply leave the district.</li><li>Younger more influential children falling to habits of other 13-14 year old children. Or my younger children being around behaviors of children going through puberty. They get that enough at home when they have to spend time with their own family. Let children be around children.</li><li>Staff issues and parents having issues with getting to multiple areas by transportation</li><li>Number of students in a school. Enough buildings in full operation with a full staff.</li><li>Increased problematic behaviors.</li><li>Busing/transportation</li><li>Not allowing enough time for the models to actually work.</li><li>parents would have less choice if they want their middle-schoolers in a smaller school environment</li><li>Parents of students in k-8 schools will not take this lightly. Their students are currently sheltered in small schools and they like that environment.</li><li>Spreading schools out so that transportation costs can be minimized (not bussing kids too far from their homes).</li><li>Parent buy in (change is hard and scary)</li><li>Teacher buy in (teachers will have to change buildings and move all their stuff)</li><li>6th graders may be too immature.</li><li>K-8 buildings have small middle schools. The students often have the same teacher for their subjects across 6-8 which allows for relationship building and positive relationships lead to student success. In a larger middle school the students can become a number and lost in the shuffle.</li><li>I find it hard to believe both these goals can be done well together. The programs most people want replicated, to my knowledge, are K-8 schools. The building of relationships across all those grades is part of the success of programs. To split these programs, attempt to create desirable middle schools, and create more of the “popular” programs for elementary is too much for it all to be done well. I really think the district either need to focus on grade reconfiguration or replicating successful programs (I think replicating successful programs is probably better). I teach at a butler lab building and was there when we replicated: it is a very difficult and hard process and it does not just happen automatically. To do that and create some sort of middle school is stretching everybody too far.</li><li>Bussing. My athletic pay would also diminish. Keeping families together</li><li>Lose of connectivity between students and educators. Our program works at 91 and 87. Leave it alone</li><li>students/parents would undergo an adjustment period</li><li>N/A</li><li>Staffing</li><li>Historically those in 6-8s experience more achievement loss than those in these same grade levels that are in K-8 programs.</li><li>Having enough buildings to house the grade changes. The movement of faculty and staff. Also more buildings would be impacted by the state test.</li><li>It is taking away from the community of learners that is provided in a pre-k through 8th grade program. Parents who want the other programs have those options through Northwest and others. Our parents have selected our program, yes in some cases, maybe giving up on some things, but the continuation is what is BEST for the students. I have given 26 years to IPS building the middle school model and it has been a HUGE success. Why would we abandon something that has proven to be successful to be like other districts? I would be happy to sit down and discuss this more.</li><li>teachers will have to go to a different school to teach, or switch grade levels to stay at their school.</li><li>Logistically buildings (and staffing them) and transportation will need to be planned out well. The emotional maturity that some of our 6th graders have will be pushed putting them with older grades, too, so we need to make sure that we are providing SEL.</li><li>I don’t see a challenge, I’d love K-5 building.</li><li>Incorporating the sixth grade students into the existing 7-8 middle school culture in a way that is inclusion and age appropriate might be a challenge.</li><li>Yet one more change to navigate w/students, staff &amp; families.</li><li>Students have been proven to have more success with fewer school transitions. Particularly at the middle school level, achievement gaps persist when students are thrust into a new learning situation after 6 years of elementary school, learning to transition from class to class, negotiate 7 different teachers' expectations, all while they are navigating the often challenging social-emotional landscape of early adolescence. When middle school students are retained as a part of the K-8 continuum, they are still connected to their earlier grade teachers, (who they can lean on for support during challenging times), they know their peers already (because they've been through the earlier years of K-8 together) and they have the very important opportunity to grow into leadership roles as they serve as Book Buddies for younger elementary students and lead clubs and school-wide community meetings. Students would not got to experience these important leadership opportunities, and their social-emotional development would thus be hindered. The sense of belonging that students develop as part of K-8 learning community would be likewise be endangered by realigning to strictly K-5 and 6- 8 configurations.</li><li>Siblings attending different schools at different start and end times</li><li>None</li><li>This will take time and money.</li><li>Changing students’ and teachers’ schools.</li><li>One challenge will be the great teachers we have in our school teaching 6th grade</li><li>Eliminate unique opportunities</li><li>Part of the success in the programs that have k-8 configurations is that they are not changing and haven’t changed in 30 years (Montessori specifically). Montessori model proves that success is achieved through being able to go through the grades at one school and work up to being seen as a leader in the school. Without the middle school option in elementary schools—we will lose more parents to townships just for the fact that they don’t trust IPS after so many flip flops in the past decade or so. If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.</li><li>I believe the longer children stay in elementary settings the better. I also believe fewer transitions offer stability and many of our IPS students are transient. How does the 6-8 plan support those two thoughts?</li><li>Losing good teachers due to no place for them to go. A lot of us our now on edge because if our school changes to a middle school where will we go.</li><li>K-8 buildings do better with 6-8 students than traditional middle school configuration. K8 buildings build and maintain community at a critical point for our middle school students.</li><li>Losing all the benefits of K8 schools - middle school is a volatile time and students do better in K8 schools where they have built community. If anything, K8 should be expanded, not reduced.</li><li>N/A</li><li>I don't know enough to contribute to this.</li><li>I think we will have parents not wanting students at so many different schools. It is possible that they could have students in three different schools.</li><li>Togetherness</li><li>Increased transitions for students</li><li>Leaving 9th with high. We should try or pilot K-3, 4-6, 7-9, 10-12</li><li>Families have made school decisions based on the current school configuration and changing that now would create uncertainty and challenges.</li><li>There is barely enough room for the 7th &amp; 8th graders we have now! Adding 150 6th graders would make the building even more chaotic!</li><li>Montessori is successful as a K-8 model.</li><li>Kids going from school to school leaving friends behind</li><li>N\A</li><li>Loss of community and more transitions for children</li><li>The k-8 model is successful BECAUSE it is k-8. You cannot replicate something AND change it and expect it to have the same success. I don't want this changed.</li><li>Losing the sense of comfort and familiarity that kids become accustomed to with a school. Starting another school at 6th grade could instill a sense of dread for the unknown and potential loss of friendships made over the last 6 years.</li><li>Loosing out on sense of community, loosing school mentors from senior age group, loose continuity &amp; relationships around teachers and staff with student.</li><li>Our family likes the k8 model.</li><li>Logistics of kids at different school and the distance between school (ex, Butler lab #60 K-5 school distance from BLS 6-8 building- will schools be close to each other). I’m very concerned about the success of our high schools too. Am I going to have to figure out how to pay to send my kids to private high school?</li><li>Behavioral issues. Keeping them together allows the older students to take positive responsibility with the younger grades.</li><li>Inconvenient. I loved the idea of my children being at the same school for several years.</li><li>Initial confusion. Funding to make this happen.</li><li>IPS sees that these schools which they say are so successful have a K-8 model. It is successful because it supports the children who have their siblings nearby through a long day, and supports caregivers who are able to connect with one school. Schools already need additional parent involvement and engagement. Putting more on their plates with multiple schools, schedules, and staff only will separate the caregiver community further from the school. This benefits no one.</li><li>Further divides families and spreads them out across a massive district with transportation issues already. o Potentially closes schools, likely in already disadvantaged neighborhoods, causing further destabilization in those places. o Introduces a major transition/change at a formative and traditionally difficult age/time in a student’s life o Separates students from faculty and staff they’ve grown to know and be known by over the course of many years. o At a time of mental health crisis in this country, forces adolescent students into new environments where they aren’t as well known and creates opportunity for someone to “fall through the cracks”</li><li>People are resistant to change</li><li>Having facilities available and ready for middle school.</li><li>People often have difficulty &amp; complaints transitioning to a new system</li><li>Losing the mentorship of upper grades with younger students, losing longer relationship</li><li>The challenge will be replicating successful schools, which are K-8, when you’re trying to remove the k-8 model. Don’t change successful school while you’re also trying to replicate them!</li><li>K-8 schools have proven to be successful. Kids are thriving. There are opportunities for leadership and it truly helps with difficult middle school years. Changing this would change everything and result in many families leaving IPS. You can’t replicate successful programs and also change grade configurations. That is changing what makes programs successful. Please replicate k-8 school that are successful on all side of the city. Leaving magnet schools on just the north side leads to inequity for all IPS students.</li><li>Many families have spent their life savings moving to be close to their preferred school. Changing the location of their child's school without sufficient warning is unfair and punitive to families that have been supporting IPS.</li><li>All IPS communication is on cost saving but nobody is talking about fund raising. Raising more funds should be the number one objective in your plan. More focus should be put on major local businesses and government for not providing enough support to have a world class education system in our city.</li><li>This plan is going to force a lot of good middle class families to make some tough decisions. Many of them will choose to move to private schools, suburbs or surrounding townships if their child's education is uncertain at IPS.</li><li>I have already started looking at other school options if my child's school no longer has a grade 6-8 and I've had many conversations with other parents doing the same.</li><li>I want my students with the small school of k-8</li><li>All</li><li>The current configuration addresses the unique programs across the IPS offerings. K-8 works beautifully at the lab school because it’s thoughtfully designed. At a neighboring school, k-5, 6-8 might make better sense. Blanket approaches do not work in education. Having a variety of programs is appealing to parents and just makes good sense.</li><li>You can’t replicate successful programs if you change them so drastically. It won’t work. Please replicate k-8 school on all sides of the city so that all kids can access nontraditional educational models through IPS. There are so many of the north side and so few anywhere else. This is unfair.</li><li>Builds stronger interpersonal relationships between students, faculty, staff, etc., and provides opportunities for older students to mentor younger kids.</li><li>school community engagement in K-5 diluted by losing 6-8 families.</li><li>Massive inconvenience</li><li>I would leave IPS if these changes occur. I think IPS really needs to think long and hard about these decisions and how this would affect the so-called high performing schools - would these schools fail if parents withdrew from public school or moved??? Then its IPS back at square one trying to prevent white flight.</li><li>More bullying, less continuity, lower academic achievement, less family involvement with middle schools, leadership opportunities for older kids, continuity of the teaching philosophy (Reggio, IB, Montessori).</li><li>We strongly prefer K-8 for our family.</li><li>IPS can act as a dynamic leader of surrounding districts and not chop up existing class growth flow. A k-8 school allows for building life long friendships as well as give kids a sense of family, support, and security.</li><li>I think there are many challenges. Most importantly, it is harder to build community with an increased number of families -- having ~45-50 families per grade allows for great community building. As the number increases, the distances from the school increases, and it is harder to build community without walking to school and meeting other families. More families will have students in multiple buildings, which divides attention for community building and makes it more difficult on parents. Students are adversely affected by attending middle vs. K-8 schools according to data from Cappella, West, and others. I would like to see more K-8 schools open in neighborhoods for walkability and community.</li><li>Providing stability. Our kids have been through the ringer these last few years with Covid. My daughter has developed close relationships with multiple teachers over the last few years. She enjoys being able to swing by and say hello to her kindergarten teacher. She's had the same music teacher and is in a club with the teacher and is looking forward to taking a leadership role when she is in 8th grade and helping the 4th graders the way she was helped. The school has a sense of community and the middle schoolers play a large role in it. That community won't be readily available to her if she has to switch schools.</li><li>Our family will also definitely look into what our other options are for middle school outside of IPS, especially if it gets implemented next year.</li><li>Students may have to ride a bus across town to attend a school, and many established school communities will be broken up. We depend a lot on the older kids in our neighborhood to help walk younger siblings/neighbors safely to and from school. It is also very nice to have many of their friends/classmates living close by for after school/weekend play opportunities.</li><li>I would miss my kids small middle school. I think so parents of their friends (a butler la school) would leave the district. We would not, but I think some parents would to want to send their kids to a "big" middle school</li><li>My kids would have to switch buildings for middle school which we really don’t want. We absolutely love the feeling of community at k-8 schools.</li><li>More parents may have children at multiple schools, which could cause transportation conflicts or work schedule conflicts for student pick up and drop off.</li><li>We love the inquiry, relationship based approach at IPS 60. Would be concerned about losing that approach in a more traditional middle school.</li><li>Rushing to a solution. I don’t hate the idea but really hope IPS is thoughtful and takes the time to do it right.</li><li>It breaks apart neighborhood schools that have just started to create footing in communities. How long has the current model been in place? Has there even been enough time to ACTUALLY study what is best for the children? Will the middle schools be divided by choice schools as well- 1 single montessori Middle school, 1 Butler lab, 1 CFI? How will there be enough Montessori middle school teachers to accommodate this when 2 of my child’s teachers quit mid year. Will buses be more available?</li><li>Transportation costs, changing pedagogical philosophies, teachers, friends, &amp; surroundings at a very pivotal age has been shown to be detrimental for kids, ire from lots of parents who signed their kids up for one thing &amp; got a 'bait &amp; switch' instead… I could write a thesis on how stupid it would be to realign the school grade structure. This state sucks for kids, families and most of all, for our underpaid teachers.</li><li>We know there is success with the k-8 model. We don’t need to align with other districts on this. Why create an unnecessary transition during the hardest years of a kids life as they begin puberty?? K-8 is a large reason I kept my kids in district as well as many other families that I know.</li><li>It is moronic, foolish, inconvenient, shortsighted, and wrong</li><li>What to do about families that selected a school partially bc it is on the k-8 model? Like us :)</li><li>It will cause significant challenges for current, high performing K-8 schools, the Montessori schools in particular - their extremely thoughtful process of honoring montessori principles while preparing students for more traditional high school experiences will be completely lost and will cause more hardship for 6-8 grade students when those are difficult enough ages.</li><li>Having parents want all children at different schools. However, if they knew what their younger children were seeing or hearing, they would be on board.</li><li>I would be sad to not see a set of grades that I’m used to seeing.</li><li>Transportation</li><li>Transportation. How are you going to address this? Parents will want to know and we know that it is already an issue</li><li>Busing/ Transportation.</li><li>I don't see one.</li><li>You will be breaking up families and transitioning many students to new buildings, which is always difficult.</li><li>Years ago when we had more k-5 &amp; 6-8 buildings, our middle schools were very low performing. A big benefit of the k-8 model is the small middle school and therefore stronger relationships between staff and students.</li><li>Reconfiguring the schools that are in K-8 right now, but it could work if programs stay the same and split between buildings. For example, if Butler Lab #60 took all of the elementary students from both lab school programs and Butler Lab #55 took all the middle school students from the programs. Similar configurations could be made for CFI schools. #2 being elementary and #27 being middle school, but both following the CFI models.</li><li>The k-8 model is a unique feature in the city and why a lot of families have chosen the schools. We would never have chosen IPS if it was k-5</li><li>Moving children to more buildings from K-12 does not solve any academic issue facing the district.</li><li>The challenge is what I alluded to above. If the district wants to realign the CFI program specifically (or any of the other programs), there need to be assurances that doing so won't change the quality of the education that students in these schools are expected to be receiving under the current status quo.</li><li>It’s wrecking what’s working</li><li>It’s a terrible idea, please do not realign the grades.</li><li>Losing the community of our school, including the excellent role modeling that our older middle school students provide for younger students. It might also increase the school size/lesson the sense of community if each grade enrolls more students.</li><li>You'll be taking kids out of a smaller school environment where many of them have grown up and are known by the teachers and staff, and throwing them into a large school where they will be one of dozens/hundreds of kids each staff member sees every semester. And you're doing it at a time in their lives when they are especially vulnerable</li></ul>

<ul><li>middle school is probably the most awkward and at risk time for young people to start down the wrong path. Example - who will see my 6th grader and know her well enough to recognize when she's struggling with life and could use some kindness instead of detention?</li><li>Also, almost every single one of the successful schools you want to expand is a K-8 school. It is a part of the formula for success. DO NOT DO THIS.</li><li>Older siblings supporting younger siblings</li><li>Giant Middle Schools did not work before</li><li>I went to K-8 and then Tech for high school. I felt well prepared for high school and like I’d had more 1-1 attention to prepare myself. My 2 older brothers (also IPS alums who went to Tech) did not do as well after coming out of the larger middle schools (Harshman and Shortridge). I felt like a leader in my school, getting to do special assignments like reading to the younger kids, helping take kindergartners to the buses, making art projects around the school and so on. I went on to graduate with my bachelors in nursing and now a Masters in nursing and feel the magnet programs (CFI and health professions at Tech) really aided me in my future success.</li><li>The retention of our best teachers will be very hard during the transition process and this makes me the most nervous since staff members have become comfortable with their schools/grade levels. This would potentially force staff that have the credentials to change their grade level (if possible) to stay at their school and with their administration, or move to a new building under a new administration and team which could drive many strong educators away from the district.</li><li>Having kids at 3 different schools, not being able to successfully replicate programs/curriculums at high achieving schools, wasting valuable instructional time while the district navigates this transition, only using existing middle school buildings that are not in reasonable proximity to our home.</li><li>Families with multi kids have to go between multiple schools Dan is less efficient and time consuming</li><li>family schedules thrown off with different start/end times. transportation, neighborhood school for my family. keeping my kids in CFI schools.</li><li>Not a lot of variety of ages</li><li>Parents would need to determine how to get siblings to two different schools (hopefully there would be staggered start times).</li><li>location logistics changes for families</li><li>I like that the older kids in CFI can do things to help the younger kids. I feel like this would be missed</li><li>Buildings being shifted, and children being unable to remain in the same building for an extended period. I appreciate our K-8 school in that the kindergarteners and the middle school students interact.</li><li>Cfi is so important and these kids only have that option through 8th grade they should be able to stay there</li><li>It is very beneficial for our kids to have interaction with older students and I think it is also great that they get to spend their entire elementary school experience in one building.</li><li>Disrupting current approach</li><li>Stressing out kids and parents with making more school choices.</li><li>Loss of sense of community which will result in more families leaving the district.</li><li>The less time we have to spend in the lottery, the better. The lottery was stressful, and caused us to consider private school or even moving, if a favorable school wasn’t assigned. Now that we are in CFI, I’m currently relieved that I don’t have to rethink the school choice until high school. I personally attended the same school from k-12 and appreciated the consistency and deep relationships.</li><li>The opportunity for interation with primary and middle years programs is invaluable. The older kids get to teach and assist the younger students and the younger students get to learn and see what opportunities are waiting for them in the middle years programs. The teachers also instruct many levels so I worry that there won't be a variety of programs offered if there aren't that many students in the building/school. What funding would be cut because there aren't enough students to justify keeping a program-band, choir, art, etc.</li><li>Students greatly benefit from attending one school K-8. Having students' educations interrupted and losing the school home that they've known for the first six years of their education would be traumatic and would weaken all of the school buildings. This is a terrible idea, second only to IPS' "innovation schools." Tell me, if money weren't a factor, would you even be considering this? If money is the only driving reason, then you know it's a bad, bad idea.</li><li>changing schools at a young age (from elementary to middle school) is very disruptive</li><li>None</li><li>I don’t want to reapply to schools. I like walking my child to school. I don’t want the problems associated with larger middle schools. If I had a kid in high school now they would NOT stay in IPS. I think you should focus on improving your high schools before realigning grades and beginning new schools with mediocre planning and results. If you realign grades you will lose many families from district schools. We will leave for middle school if this is the choice.</li><li>Identifying how to break up schools as currently composed.</li><li>We did this in other districts we lived, and it is atrocious in terms of social stability, the peer pressure is loads worse in separate middle schools. The K-8 model was something we moved to IPS specifically for, but now I'm not sure we will stay of these changes to the schools go into effect. It will only serve to increase issues related to equitable access, transportation, available specials in all these new schools, etc.</li><li>Will my child still go to a CFI? Will they still be with their peer group or get split? I don't understand how they elementary schools will feed into the intermediate schools. Also, it's a logistical challenge to have 2 kids at 2 different places. Staying k-8 reduces the amount of years we are split between two schools.</li><li>I don’t see any as transportation is provided</li><li>See above. I don't think any small pros outweighs the cons of a separate middle school</li><li>There would have to be another lottery for middle school. This would mean more issuers with transportation as well. We live a half block from IPS 70 so it is very convenient for us to walk there.</li><li>1. Surrounding districts are not as Urban and fragmented as IPS, and thus lend themselves better to the elementary and middle school specific model. Implementing this model in IPS will lead to kids spending a lot more time on buses, when they could be learning. Because they will have to travel further in inner city traffic to reach the consolidated school buildings. 2. It will not be as neighborhood friendly, or as conducive to the children building relationships with each other: The magnet schools are successful because of the proximity zones. If you have a high percentage of local children attending, then they will encounter their friends out side of school locally. If these children scatter to the wind after elementary school to middle schools this neighborhood aspect is lost. It's not like less urban surrounding districts where children move from an elementary school to a middle school together, because the schools cannot be consolidated as easily (See point 1 above). 3. You are introducing another lottery for the middle schools, and another source of stress for parents AND children. It's one thing explaining to a child who is entering a school district for the first time that they cant go to the same school as friend 'x', but they will make new friends. But doing this again, at middle school age, when they are already in the school system and have established relationships, will be extremely traumatic. See point 2 above why this problem doesn't exist in surrounding less urban districts where lotteries do not exist and children progress through a school system without 'lottery' restrictions. 4. Their is a wealth of neighborhood private school options surrounding the high performing magnet schools. These neighborhoods contribute to the successful IPS schools precisely because parents are involved in, and conscientious about their children's education. These schools are the competition for the high performing IPS magnet schools, and they are not about to transition to a middle school specific model. I believe talking to other parents that if this model is implemented, many parents will have reduced interest in their children attending IPS due to all the issues elaborated in points 1 through 3 above and reconsider private schooling. The net result will be that IPS loses out on these conscientious and involved parents and what they bring to the school system.</li><li>Whilst I understand the motivations behind this solution, I believe it to be misguided. I understand that their is backlash about the perceived 'privilege' some children receive having proximity priority for high performing magnet schools. But I think this 'solution' introduces more problems than it solves.</li><li>how will the realignment look? will choice schools have specific middle schools? my challenge is the number of questions I have regarding any potential change.</li><li>I think there is a greater likelihood of losing students from the district during the transition from elementary to middle school</li><li>If this requires yet another lottery process for students entering grade 6, this will undoubtedly frustrate many families. The lottery has winners and losers. For families that do not feel comfortable with their school placement after the lottery process, they may choose private schools instead. Also, it is not clear how having separate middle schools will actually increase diversity at CFI programs. To expand diversity in CFI schools, IPS should promote CFI programs to neighborhoods of color that are not far from CFI schools (like Crown Hill, neighborhoods around state fairgrounds, etc). IPS/CFI should work to create a partnership with diverse neighborhoods in order to attract students beyond the proximity zones.</li><li>I think that the K through eight program has show tremendous benefits for children with consistency with teachers and education it would be ashamed of IPS changes</li><li>Placing more kids of the same age in one place is not a solution. They don’t model after older kids nor do they mentor younger children. My wife is teacher and we believe consolidation is the worst thing for high attendance schools .</li><li>Need to maintain the specialty program (eg CFI) throughout and make sure CFI k-5 are ensured they can continue in 6-8. Also need to keep schools as neighborhood schools. I’m not putting my child on a bus for an hour to go to CFI 6-8 when our current k-5 CFI is within a minute of my house.</li><li>I believe you would lose a lot of middle school aged kids from the CFI to private/other districts….we lose some already at this level and combining or relocation could cause more to leave. We are at CFI 84 and have basically no kids go to IPS high schools. If you want to retain the smart kids that can afford private schooling through middle school, I would consider keeping the current model. I could be wrong and it might be fine, but our neighborhood bubble school where everyone’s walks and knows each other is a beautiful thing.</li><li>It will drastically change the experience for middle schoolers. Middle schoolers in the K8 schools seem to stay young and innocent longer. I appreciate this! There is no rush to grow up too fast. There is a sweet sense of community in k-8 schools which appeals to our family greatly and is a reason we didn’t send our daughter to Washington township. We have a seventh grader and I will be so sad if she can’t graduate from her current school and completing her CFI IB education.</li><li>This is further disruption in our kids education center it’s Covid they have been through enough disruption.</li><li>Switching schools more often/more disruption for students. Less mentorship to younger students from older ones</li><li>Breaking up successful schools/major disruption</li><li>Kids at different schools</li><li>Chaos moving kids from one school to another. Kids in same family would have multiple drop off/pick ups causing logistic problems.</li><li>More uncertainty is introduced if a child isn’t guaranteed a spot in the middle school with the same program</li><li>Having kids at different schools that start at different times. I think having 6-8 with younger kids helps them to build leadership skills and encourages better behavior.</li><li>My child is currently in a K-8 program at CFI, and we selected it specifically because of the CFI program. If IPS were to remove that option, we would want to have a CFI MYP experience for him.</li><li>In reading on this some it appears these is an academic decline in 6-8 graders who transition to new schools. I prefer the K-8 model for development and the safety of a known environment for learning.</li><li>Students may end up with longer commutes to/from school</li><li>I think the community established in a K-8 school is essential to student development and cannot be achieved in the same manner through K-5 and 6-8 schools. Realigning the grades would also increase the change in environment for kids.</li><li>Kids going from learning environments that they’re thriving in, to a larger mix of students with less qualified leadership—keep the schools smaller and focus on hiring qualified leaders for underperforming schools—leadership and parent involvement are key. Without those two items programs like CFI, Butler Lab School and others will underperform.</li><li>People will leave the district if change occurs too quickly. Also, most worrisome, is if reform of K-5 doesn’t occur, then the integration and attempt to facilitate a school community will be too late. If we focus too much on making room/bringing more kids to certain schools, we are not honoring what could be the most special thing for IPS - location and walkability. Location/proximity to each school is a huge factor in improving the comradeship of a school, the camaraderie is what keeps kids in school, and could be this way no matter the area. Once kids are in school, our great teachers can do their jobs which ultimately leads to more success. I propose we 1) continue research on the k5 and 6-8 separation and create a long term plan to better serve that age group and 2) look at location/proximity as a positive aspect for IPS, a means to determine allocation of resources, and a way to improve parent and student engagement and pride in their neighborhood school.</li><li>Splitting up families into different schools</li><li>It does not allow for the same type of community building and ability for parents to commit to IPS through 8th grade (rather than going private) that I believe makes choice schools so popular and successful.</li><li>We chose our school partially because of the K-8 model. Breaking that up during my children’s school career would be devastating to our family and would likely cause us to leave. IPS tried this model in the past and switched because it was not working. After the last 2 years of school during a pandemic, why on earth would you look to make such a huge change to our school system? Let our children settle back into a normal school life before forcing yet another change on them. This is very poor timing and not thought through enough.</li><li>Too many teachers per grade! 2-teacher teams like our choice programs have now make project-based learning and field trips easier to plan. With 3+ classes per grade it's harder to manage funds, supplies, and planning for these types of educational experiences. Less differentiating and individualizing happens when teachers are expected to all teach in tandem. Keeping K-8 buildings helps kids experience a small-school feel even though they are in a huge district. Kids feel more like numbers when there are so many kids per grade.</li><li>Disruption of kids already at k-8 schools.</li><li>Many of us chose schools based on the current configuration and do not want a change in the middle of our children’s education</li><li>Does not allow continuity of the wholistic educational experience in the same way that can be achieved in K-8 within one building. With more grades together I’m the same building, this allows for the resources (teachers, students, physical resources, facilities) to provide differentiation opportunities. Also, families with multiple children spanning in age can have one school that they’re working with for a longer period, one community, rather than 2-3 different drop offs, school schedules, etc. this can be extremely challenging for parents to manage.</li><li>breaking apart a successful school doesn't mean what's created will be successful</li><li>How is transportation going to work? My kids can’t take a bus as it is because we live too close to the school; never mind they have to cross Kessler without a crossing guard since we cannot get a bus.</li><li>I’ve not heard anything positive about the current transportation’s efficiency as it was this past year. Now you want to shuffle everyone around the city? What a mess. This will lead to MORE time students aren’t in a classroom learning thanks to unreliable transportation.</li><li>Shuffle everyone around and NO ONE has the opportunity to walk or bike to school safely.</li><li>Again, let the wonderful communities and families that have built ties over the years continue to do so by KEEPING K-8 schools. We feel a part of the community, neighborhood and school because it’s K-8.</li><li>Realigning grade configuration will mean parents who have the means to send their children to private schools in the area will likely do so. Neighbors in our K-8 community CHOOSE K-8 school opportunities; it allows children to be children in a nurturing, loving environment. It allows middle school students to build bonds with younger students. It allows families to build community for the long-haul, not just a few years. THAT’S what building back better is all about; not just making changes in the midst of 2+ years of crisis for our children who don’t recall what a normal school experience is.</li><li>Clearly, I have strong opinions about this and am happy to share more thoughts. I’m an educator myself who chose to send my own children to a K-8, neighborhood school, despite them being able to go to a top-ranked school district in the state. It is more important for our family to build community in our neighborhood, through our K-8 school, than attend a suburban district.</li><li>This will make things incredibly difficult for our family, given the 5 year age gap between my three children.</li><li>The lottery system is stressful and I’d like not to have to try to get my child into a school that is right for her again for middle school. We are very happy with CFI 84 and would like to stay there as long as possible.</li><li>Splitting up children from the same family into different buildings</li><li>Constant uncertainty. For our family with two daughters just starting out at IPS (7 and 4 years old), our family will constantly be worrying about the upcoming lotteries into these new, untested schools. My 7 year was in a lottery for the current system, would be in a lottery for whatever the new configuration is for grade school, a lottery for middle school, and a lottery for high school. They will be far enough apart in age that they will not benefit from the sibling match for middle school, so there is the potential for no consistency between their two middle school experiences. So, instead of being able to go to an established K-8 at a school that is 2 blocks from the home my wife and I have lived in for 12 years, they will be IPS test subjects bouncing from newly established IPS grade and middle schools until they might finally be at the same high school for one year.</li><li>realignment is pointless and feels like an arbitrary move not based on the mental and educational welfare of the children. k-8 is a better long term environment for our child. the 6-8 graders mentor the younger kids and the younger kids benefit from that modelling of behavior. It also cuts down on the amount of anxiety and ambiguity that going to middle school brings to kids that age since a) she would have grown up and gone to school with the same kids and b) its a community focused school.</li><li>I also hear from the high schools that the CFI k-8 programs develop students that are more ready to learn and better adjusted than those who come from a middle school environment. Please don't realign the grades!"</li><li>Losing the opportunity for middle school students to guide &amp; mentor younger grades. Practicing &amp; modeling leadership roles, responsibilities, &amp; accountability in this way is confidence-building for older students and inspiring for younger students. It offers a sense of value, importance, &amp; belonging for middle school students, an anchor / grounded-ness for an age group that is finding their way in life as they transition to young adults and high school. allowing siblings to remain together at one school as long as possible</li><li>Specifically cfi school 2 should be kept k thru 8.</li><li>We feel our children would have a greater chance at excelling if they were able to stay at their CFI2 school until 8th grade is completed. It would be a huge challenge on so many levels to have to change schools after 5th grade. We beg you to not make this change! Location is important, confidence is built, friendships are formed and relationships with their teachers are so important. The longer the students can stay at a school, increases the likelihood that these things happen.</li><li>We are at a CFI school and would want a CFI middle school education like we thought we would be getting. My concern would be that it would follow a more traditional model of middle school which is not what we were looking for.</li><li>Middle school years are challenging enough without the transition to a larger, unfamiliar place without the peers that they've been with up until that point. Furthermore, for schools with an IB curriculum that extends to grade 8, how would that be handled?</li><li>We love that 84 is so close to our house and that so many of our neighbors attend the school as well. The grade realignment would likely send children to schools further away and with multiple children at different schools, it makes logistics more tricky.</li><li>Kids having to move to several schools. I love that my kids will only go to two buildings (elementary and high school), both of which are currently walkable for us and why we chose these schools.</li><li>See answer above. I would much prefer more k-8 models, and it is one of the reasons we decided to stay with Cold Spring, as it has expanded to k-8. It is more supportive, better for families of multiple children.</li><li>Students and families would lose the cohesion and sense of school community they have built if at 6th grade they are not t all allowed to stay together at a nearby school. Requiring a reapplication period for 6th would mean they likely get split up. I think that would really be detrimental to everyone involved.</li><li>One of the reasons it was shifted to the way it is was maturity of 6th graders and being with older students. Is that no longer a concern? If it is then how is that going to be accounted for?</li><li>Big shift and transition</li><li>Unreasonable fears that parents will have about their students safety in larger, more unfamiliar schools. “Change” itself will be a challenge for IPS parents in this particular area of the district. Many of these choice programs are safe spaces because they are small, and not diverse. Parents will likely feel compelled to flee the district after elementary, instead of after 8th grade as is typical now. 6-8 programs will need to be carefully curated and “sold” to families to keep them in the district. However, I think middle schools will in the end help retain those students into high school if done right.</li><li>Different schools would mean splitting up my kids at different schools</li><li>When transportation isn't available, I have to take our grand child to school, separating our grand kids would be more strain on us. Further, there are a limited number of schools available. I feel that this should not change.</li><li>It would be hard to transition the students out.</li><li>Discipline in middle schools -disruption "restart" again</li><li>It’s super convenient when you have multiple children in the same building, also I like that by the time you reach middle school in a K-8 building, you know all the staff and they know you. That is really comforting and helps in many ways.</li><li>Worse for working parents dropping off at different schools or dealing with multiple bus and school times.</li><li>Siblings at different school and different hours</li><li>Siblings Not get preference on neighborhood schools if older sibling is in middle school</li><li>Where to begin? The history of trying to urban middle school instruction throughout Indiana? The specific IPS challenges of doing so? The only good middle school experiences IPS offers now are within the context of a community of k-8 model. You propose to end all of those, naively thinking that you can simply recreate that same feel in stand alone middle schools? That is either hubris or follow, or both. You would also destroy the few functioning school communities where staff have built cultures and start from scratch. Simply put, after destroying nearly all of traditional high school by myopic board decisions within the last five years, your new proposal is poised to ruin middle school, too. Please realize this is not the step forward for IPS.</li><li>The building capacity-does the district have building space for multiple middle schools? I’d like to see the model support 4-6 middle schools depending on numbers (600/700) students per school. I’m not sure the numbers warrant the number of total schools. I also see challenges regarding the choice and innovation schools. If there isn’t a middle school option for those schools, parents will likely look to surrounding township, charter or private schools.</li><li>A middle school model will not work if the purpose is just to financially move bodies for the benefit of buildings and space. There needs to be a clear purpose, a true commitment to a program with more support than we already have, and extremely strong leadership. I also have concerns about mixing the teaching philosophies. I do believe that keeping the IB model would be a way to encompass the different philosophies and give a common purpose and direction. This would be a way to create a successful school model, but there would need to be a huge initiative to onboard teachers and staff. If a school is opened up and students and teachers are thrown together without preparation, it will not work. I believe a middle school team needs to be given time before the school opens to create curriculum and essential goals before opening the school. As an IPS middle school teacher, I would love to talk more with IPS leadership about how we can make this school successful.</li><li>You have multiple (6+ locations) that are currently k-8 and have very specific programming, how will we be able to ensure those children are able to continue their current programming, i.e. will we create CFI/Butler Lab middle schools, how will the feeding process work if that’s the case? It seems if we went to the current lottery system for middle school there would be a high number of current IB/Reggio kids who would lose their seats in these programs. Speaking from an IB perspective, specifically, there is a heavy community component to their learning at having the PYP and MYP programs in the same building help fuel this.</li><li>Loosing students at the transition years in middle school and high school</li><li>Large schools with an enormous amount of students does not create a positive intimate environment for growing young children to develop relationships and focus on academic learning. Besides, who really liked middle school in the tradition 6-8 format? I've never met anyone who liked that. There is time for that kind of environment, it's called high school.</li><li>The k-8 schools have a track record of kids doing well and being prepared for high school. Having spent time in the middle schools, I don’t believe that the current middle schools are providing the same level of education as the current k-8 programs.</li><li>Transportation</li><li>Ips enrollment for middle school would decline drastically as students from high performing schools would look to private schools or schools from other districts.</li><li>It will take some readjustment on the teachers and students parts, but any kind of change takes readjustment. I think moving to a K-5 and 6-8 grade structure throughout the district would be very beneficial.</li><li>I have taught at a k-8 school, a 7-12 school, and a 6-8 school. I think that the k-8 program is actually the best for middle schoolers because it provides extra stability and a feeling of community. It also makes it easier for families with elementary and middle school students. I think a lot of middle school students at the lab school stay because of their younger siblings and because their families already like the school. If they had to go to a different school I think their families would choose to go out of the district. This would worsen the retention that choice schools currently have without building it at the neighborhood schools.</li><li>Having positive mentors for younger ones, having older children understanding that they are leaders to those younger than them therefore encouraging them to do better. My daughter has loved the k-8 model and it has made her into a more responsible individual.</li><li>Listening to the midtown parents complain that they might be inconvenienced with their “private public schools”</li><li>The current model is working why take away from it. Some k-8 is a smaller setting why put our kids in bigger classroom sizes</li><li>Separating siblings into different buildings, lack of community, the strain of a huge transition like this on our students’ learning</li><li>Potentially forcing parents to go through the lottery system again when they were under the impression they didn’t have to</li><li>Changing schools and having to try to get into the school we want again</li><li>Separate middle schools lead to poorer attendance, test scores, self esteem, etc.</li><li>SO MANY challenges. You have had this model in past. It DID NOT work. What makes you think this time will be different? It won’t. Where will you put these students? If you think housing a middle school in a half empty high school will be a good option you are wrong. 6-12 on same campus is an awful idea. How will you keep the current IB programs as they are? Will there be a CFI specific middle school or will it be a program housed with everything else (which loses the appeal) - biggest challenge may be retaining your high performing students who are currently at your K-8 buildings. We don’t want this and will exit IPS at middle school level for a more stable program. People with the means will leave (as they did before - and continue to do since you reorganized your HS programs again.) Teachers included. They don’t want the change either and will find open positions elsewhere leaving IPS with a building full of subs or semi qualified educators to fill those vacancies. Ridiculous.</li><li>In smaller schools, K-8 allows school communities to grow together over more years adding stability and continuity for students as well as mentorship opportunities among students.</li><li>The privileged parents being grumpy about this and throwing their privilege around. Stand up for equality and make this change.</li><li>Less consistency for students who have already had to deal with 2-3 years of uncertainty in their schooling, having to leave a location that may be closer to people’s homes, less of an opportunity for older students to demonstrate leadership and for younger students to learn from older students, taking students out of environments where they have bonded with peers and educators</li><li>I do not believe schools should be realigned. Other districts are able to have this model because their k-5 schools are of the same model. Combining CFI, butler lab, etc kids into one school would cause too much variance in education levels. This would cause a further exodus of parents to surrounding suburbs. All schools need to be fixed first to the same education level before this step should be taken. Please call or email to discuss further. Thanks.</li><li>Space to accommodate all MYPs and finding enough qualified teachers (ie specials and foreign language teachers) as we can’t find staff to currently fill those positions.</li><li>Needing to do the lottery again for middle school</li><li>Lack of consistency for students, more change for students, harder for families to keep track of students over the years, and potentially puts older students in situations they aren't ready for.</li><li>I don’t want to lose the strong IB program that we have with CFI. I would want their to be an IB specific middle school, and I am hoping this option would not mean having to go through another round of a lottery.</li><li>A massive amount of families will leave the district for middle school and likely 4/5 to secure spots in neighboring public/private schools for middle school.</li><li>Lack of funding for additional schools</li><li>making sure kids get into schools close to home</li><li>I really do not like this idea! IPS has a great opportunity to shape kids and instill confidence in the current model. Kids can be at the same school as their siblings and have the experience of becoming leaders. One of the main reasons we chose IPS was because of the k-8 model. The middle school experience does not appeal to us at all! Give 7th and 8th graders a chance to be leaders in the school!</li><li>Many parents chose K-8 schools because they were K-8. We are trying to keep our young teens grounded and behaving appropriately.</li><li>This would create bigger schools where more at risk children will fall through the cracks. The K-8 model is popular because it’s intimate and better teacher-student interaction. The students gain social emotional and mental health benefits as well as reap stronger academic progress and teachers have less students</li><li>The destruction of already established and thriving communities such as CFI schools. Our family benefits from the wide age range.</li><li>Splitting up families and communities already built within the school.</li><li>We chose IPS for the K-8 model and the prodigy of the K-8 school to our home. If popular choice programs are expanded to other areas of the city, where will middle schools for each program be located?</li><li>Ensuring specialty programs continue through middle school.</li><li>It would be difficult for parents who chose a school particularly because it was k-8 to support their child’s needs.</li><li>Transportation</li><li>What happens to my soon-to-be middle school Montessori child? Is there a montessori middle school?</li><li>A primary concern is the quality and safety of the middle school experience. When the district moved to virtually eliminate middle schools not that many years ago, the middle schools were almost uniformly low-performing. I haven't heard anything from the district to indicate what would be done to assure that we don't end up in the same situation again. Also, although I recognize that some students really benefit from the choice and freedom of the stand-alone middle school experience, some students in grades 6-8 thrive in the more intimate, nurturing atmosphere of a K-8, and deserve to have that choice. Also, what would become of the middle school piece of programs like IB and Montessori? That also has not been shared publicly,</li><li>No doubt higher costs to implement, with no immediately obviously added value.</li><li>For a lot of people the biggest issue seems to be the typical IPS fashion of just springing huge changes on large groups of people. For the most part it makes sense but for so many that is not what they "signed up for" so giving people a couple years to say this is what we are changing to in say 2024/25 school year, people will have time to make moves/changes/decisions on what they think is best for their student and how they've been prepared vs just a quick change.</li><li>Unless the building is on the same grounds, the change could impact access/vicinity for all families and may or may not be considered equitable. Having older and younger students in the same building or on the same grounds provides endless opportunities for older students to be more involved in, and positively influential to the younger grades. Acclimating to a completely new environment during some of their most developmentally challenging years can be unnecessarily stressful for students.</li><li>I like the small k-8 community. Our kids are 5 years apart in age so they would be at the same school longer under the current model. I would also miss the opportunity younger elementary kids have to see positive role models in the older middle school kids.</li><li>Disruption to families and students in already difficult ages</li><li>I can’t think of any.</li><li>Needing more administrators to accomplish the goal of focusing more on each age/maturity group.</li><li>Destroying the ability for our children to attend local school they can walk to. Sense of community at CFI84 will be lost.</li><li>Recreating the quality experience at a smaller k-8 school at a large middle school will be difficult</li><li>People do not want change - especially in high performing schools</li><li>Parents with multiple aged children</li><li>Families having kids in multiple schools -older kids don't get the benefit of interacting with younger kids and vice versa -alters the community of the school to be less wellrounded -middle school aged kids get so much leadership opportunity to work with the younger grades and lead all-school initiatives.-Families would be less connected with switching schools at 6th grades.</li><li>When we enrolled our oldest at the BLS #60, a significant consideration was the K-8 model. While that was ten years ago, I have not seen any recent data/research that supports traditional a elementary/middle school model being better for students academically/socially. More specifically, when we joined the BLS, a major talking point was K-8 model helps prevent the academic/social "drop off" seen in most traditional middle schools…citing many students never bounce back after falling behind in a traditional middle school setting. What has changed from a teaching and learning perspective? Are you able to share the data IPS is using to support reverting back to K-5 and 6-8 buildings? On a related note, the question above seems to be biased by suggesting an alignment with surrounding districts is a positive move. We don't see it that way…</li><li>There is cross-grade support I see in our K-8 with the middle school students setting amazing examples for the younger children. The older kids also get a highly necessary sense of stability and security while going through those typically challenging middle school years.</li><li>Lose the small school community. One of the many reasons we chose the school we are at.</li><li>Aligning School partnership for transition grades</li><li>Multiple siblings being in different locations is a burden to parents.</li><li>Would parents choose to keep their kids in the schools if they knew they might not be in that school from K-8? IPS might lose students. It is really helpful for families to have kids in the same schools for as long as possible.</li><li>Loss of the value of elementary versus middle school interaction which has been proven beneficial for both groups. We have chosen a k-8 for this reason. It also helps with the SEL of middle schoolers and provides them with early leadership opportunities. For families with multiple kids, it is a challenge to have kids in different buildings (across town!) and remain active. Parents of K-8 have a better opportunity for serving the school community longer.</li><li>There are many students currently in K-8 schools that would struggle with an abrupt change.</li><li>Current middle school only offerings are not as strong as K8 options, so it’s a concern if that persists.</li><li>It disrupts communities.</li><li>School bus issue, siblings separated, reduced number of IPS schools within our area</li><li>Ensuring students leaving high demand/ high-performing schools will have the same opportunities in the new schools. Please do not realign the grades!!!</li><li>We lose the mentorship and the community feel</li><li>The mentor / mentee relationships between K - 5 and middle schoolers in the K - 8 schools is invaluable.</li><li>Would we need to lottery in to a CFI school again if we are already at CFI? When we got a spot at CFI, we thought we would not need to seek another school until High School. It would not be fair to current CFI families to force us to lottery into a CFI model/International Baccalaureate middle school. Current CFI families should be prioritized for a new CFI/IB middle school if that is created.</li><li>It would split up siblings in different grades and make it more difficult for parents (but it's not about us).</li><li>Many families would leave IPS for private schools, charter schools and other public districts. K-8 schools are one of IPS's strong points. Families that decided to stay would likely leave IPS in 6th grade instead of 9th grade.</li><li>Moving to new location at a difficult time, developmentally. We sought out only K-8 schools for our daughter, that was a non-negotiable for us.</li><li>Many programs may only be working as well as they are because of their small scale. Sidener, for example, is already not full, so it has smaller class sizes and the whole specialty is in one building. Programs such as high ability and Spanish Immersion might not work as well if they are a smaller program within a larger school. IPS has been touting the advantages of K-8 buildings for many years, let's not forget those advantages and the reasons that led the district to adopt K-8 buildings in the first place. A better choice might be to eliminate K-6 and 7-8 buildings. Combining these smaller schools could allow for more resources per school without a complete overhaul of the whole system. If a drastic change is decided upon, I think that everyone would benefit from a longer planning period, and not trying to jump right into the change in 2023. Also, there is not a benefit to realigning the grades just to match surrounding districts. That's not a reason to do it.</li><li>You are potentially dividing families and making families navigating multiple schools. The IPS bus system is not reliable. How would a family navigate getting three-four kids to different school if a bus didn’t show? Additionally, the k-8 have smaller class sizes. You would be increasing grade size and potentially lowering a child’s academic success. Middle school is critical stage. Having kids blend during these years have proven to be difficult for so many districts.</li><li>We have 2 graduates of IPS 91 and 2 current students there and we strongly want our two current students to continue at 91 through 8th grade to be a part of the great middle school program there with the friends they have made there. If middle school is removed from 91 we will move our children to Washington Township.</li><li>I would imagine it would take a great deal of effort to make the switch and determine which schools become K-5 schools and which schools become 6-8 schools. I would like to see middle schools that have focused programs (i.e., CFI, dual-language, STEM, etc.) and that may be harder to do.</li><li>Families prefer K-8 to build relationships with staff and have their kids in the same school for longer. I’m concerned families will choose nearby non-IPS options that will remain K-8 and we will lose massive amounts of ADM funding over time.</li><li>K-8 often provides more one-on-one support, student/teacher familiarity, less fights &amp; other issues very prevalent in township middle schools.</li><li>I am very unenthusiastic with this plan. I have volunteered at my son's K-8 Montessori school (91), specifically with the middle schoolers. I appreciate the example they set for the younger children in their leadership and peace education. There are strong educational advantages to this model. Before IPS went to a K-6 and K-8 model, IPS middle schools have underperformed academically. In fact, I've already heard of middle school teachers at my son's school who will LEAVE their positions if this change goes into effect. PLEASE give preexisting schools the option to stay K-6 or K-8. It will absolutely kill our teachers', parents', and student's morale to have the rug yanked out from under them and have this change implemented in current schools. Our family will leave the district after 5th grade if this change is made. Our school's community is so strong and the parents are the BEST! This type of change is not in our school community's best interest, in my opinion. Feel free to contact me for more feedback.</li><li>Students may not have a consistent learning approach and experience if there is variability amongst the feeder elementary schools. Would need to look at what benefits and challenges result because of this.</li><li>Our daughter is happy at her current cfi school and would love to continue there till 8th grade. We have an incoming k student who would also love to be in the same school as her sister. Realigning would bring about transportation issues as there are not many school in our vicinity and transportation was extremely challenging last year. Please Do NOT realign the grades as it would cause hardships to students and sibling and friend separation. Thank you.</li><li>The major challenge that I see is dissecting small strong and healthy schools. The high preforming schools and the smaller k-8 schools. Breaking them apart will negatively affect their performance. That is not replication, but disintegration.</li><li>transportation and timelines with buses and parent drop offs</li><li>Change consumes a huge amount of resources and impacts all stakeholders; is there a sufficient payoff? Also, IPS could benefit from more consistency, IMO.</li><li>I like middle schoolers to stay with smaller set of students that they’ve grown up with vs mixing middle schoolers with kids from other schools. As a parent, I won’t know the new kids or their families. Middle school gets catty, kids grow up faster and that’s negative. 6th graders are too young to be mixed with 8th graders. Would rather only 7-8, leaving grade 6 in elementary if we separate. K-8 means fewer school changes, that stability helps kids mature in comfortable setting before separating in high school. If you have several children this could mean more schools at same time to manage. Different start times, different activities that could conflict. Not helpful as all children at same school, only k-8 or high school max different schools is 2, vs possibility of dealing with 3 schools.</li><li>Keeping children in a K-8 school has better outcomes socially and academically</li><li>Actually seeing it happen. Until then, I communicate with my child and have developed a relationship where she communicates with us.</li><li>It breaks up educational continuity for the children.</li><li>We would miss the small family feel of our school, and how the older kids look out for the younger kids. I honestly don’t know if we would stay in IPS if they make this shift; we would go to another school with the K-8 model.</li><li>This would be a waste of resources with no benefit.</li><li>I think it would hurt the students. There is a lot of older kids to younger kids mentorship that happens at our school, and I think it's a benefit to both the older and younger kids. I think this is one of the reasons why these "high demand, higher-performing programs" work as well as they do, so by eliminating the K-8 model you're eliminating a big piece of why these schools are working so well. I also have to say I think it will make IPS less attractive to many parents. Most dual-working households spend the first 6+ years of parenting constantly figuring out childcare. It's such a relief to have all one's kids at one school for awhile. The notion that we'll have to figure out high school one day seems okay because it feels so far off. We also depend on older siblings to help younger siblings.</li><li>Splitting up siblings/ transportation. Changing parents school plans mid education</li><li>Lose the special learning of k-8</li><li>One thing that I like is the mentorship of the smaller grades by the middle school students, i.e. book buddies, etc.</li><li>Families with many kids in school benefit from having them all in one place. Consistency, comfort, community built through the years.</li><li>I will leave IPS is K-8 doesn't continue</li><li>We spent 18 months looking for a house close to our current school that we could purchase for our family of five. We want to keep our children within walking distance to school for as long as possible. This is one of the reasons we love our CFI school so much. I like that my children can walk and ride their bikes to their classmates houses, and parents can easily help each other out with school drop offs or pick ups. It really does take a village to raise children, and I think our CFI school and neighborhood does an awesome job of taking care of everyone! I do not feel this would be the case if the older students were forced to go elsewhere. My children want to go to the same school together as long as possible, and so do my husband and I!</li><li>Students at high performance schools be may elect to leave IPS rather than participate in a grade realignment.</li><li>Being in a K-8 school right now, the K-8 population was a strong reason I CHOSE this school. I think it is massively important to have upper and lower grades housed together. The younger children can have strong role models in the older children. The older children practice responsibility and leadership. It is also helps families stay together and is one less thing for parents to worry about.</li><li>Being in a current CFI school, how would you guarantee that my children would be seamlessly migrated to a CFI middle school with the same caliber and academic programming as their K-5 school?</li><li>IPS does NOT have a solid history of running middle schools, how will you guarantee this does not become another failed educational endeavor?</li><li>Many families, including ours have planned for sibling preference for families…how will you guarantee placement for families in these preferred schools for incoming kindergartners if the next oldest sibling is entering grade 6?? This would have been a massive change from when the family started at the initial school</li><li>It seems to be working well with CFI schools keeping grades K-8 in the same building.</li><li>That they will not have well qualified and the appropriate numbers of staff to support this.</li><li>Maintaining the quality of the schools that get broken up. A strength of many of these K8 programs stems from creating an environment where students can mature and grow within a continuous and shared culture. Breaking successful programs into two would lose that dynamic. And there's no guarantee that both "halves" or components would rebuild the successful culture of the original. It doesn't make sense to me that IPS would intentionally break programs that have been successful. Replication seems like the way to build on the current successes - not realignment. Please don't ruin the programs that have been working.</li><li>Very disruptive to existing schools and students. Limited benefit. Creates additional transition for all children</li><li>How will choice programs transition? So if your child is at a CFI currently will they be able to continue at a CFI middle school?</li><li>I like k-8 schools because it eliminates unnecessary transitions to different schools during the child’s school career. I like the interaction between the older and younger students, and the sense of leadership the older kids can gain as they grow older.</li><li>Changing working schools unnecessarily.</li><li>Two of the main reasons we chose to attend CFI was having our children at the school community they have been developed in from K-8. The other is the IB program and if IPS is not strategic in how middle schools will be developed/split our children will not be able to complete the IB curriculum.</li><li>Ips already did this once and moved away from it back to K 8. Parents might move students earlier if the schools are k6 and leave the district.</li><li>Lose the appeal of the neighborhood school and the consistency of K-8. Just because the suburbs do it, doesn't make it a good idea. Let the kids go to school in the neighborhood that they live with the kids the live near. It makes "Indianapolis" feel like a small town.</li><li>Major disruption to schools like CFIs that thrive on K-8 model…disrupts the IB curriculum, family dynamics, the learning environment desired by families wanting the IB program and inquiry based learning. HUGE HUGE MISTAKE TO CHANGE THIS MODEL!!! CFI Schools have proven successful and should not be broken up but rather replicated and expanded.</li><li>Please don’t change the current model.</li><li>A lot of people like having their children at the same school through 8th grade, so people might not want to make this change.</li><li>Grouping schools in a way that still fits the IB model.</li><li>Covid, change, kids have been through enough the last few years</li><li>Another lottery/risk of not getting a spot in the middle school which follows the elementary school program, loss of close-knit school community during the vulnerable middle school years, loss of mentorship opportunities between older/younger grades, transportation issues for families with multiple children having to get to/from schools.</li><li>My child would have three schools during their time at IPS. I'm concerned with him having to be placed in a new cohort at sixth grade with the lottery system.</li><li>I think that keeping students in the same building k-8 builds stronger community and relationships for students which results in less stress, less behavioral issues, and improved learning outcomes. More support should be provided to 6-8 teachers while they remain in the current k-8 school buildings.</li><li>Lack of community experience for children attending K-8 if transition, larger classes with less community feel</li><li>Unnecessary stress on kids for changing schools</li><li>Physical space in some buildings</li><li>As a family with a CFI student we don't see the potential realignment as beneficial. The students have a sense of community established. Having 6-8 graders around the younger kids gives them a sense of responsibility to act as leaders which is life lesson that can't be learned in a 6-8 building.</li><li>The challenge I see is keeping the students on track and happy. I think a lot of families will leave IPS if this happens. I have seen so many benefits from a K-8. Those middle school years are hard and keeping the students in an elementary school while giving them a middle school experience has proven to keep the students happy and safe. They are then excited and ready for the bigger environment in high school. Transitioning from K-8 will be the demise of the CFI schools which is truly heartbreaking.</li><li>I think this is a horrible idea for current middle school students who are in their 7th grade year, that would spend their final middle school year having to be disrupted from teachers, friends, and their neighborhood school to move to a new middle school for one year. IPS is going to lose students and teachers in this model and especially in the CFI model.</li><li>Building space</li><li>Additional school transitions are psychologically hard on children…I believe this is why IPS switch to the K-8 model (Research based)</li><li>We chose our current school because it was K-8. We have loved the environment of having older and younger students interacting in clubs and activities. I don’t see how 6-8 grades coming from CFI would be able to continue their IB education if schools combine at middle school. I think there would be a large exodus of families to private schools if our current school changes to K-5.</li><li>Losing kids to other school districts in middle school</li><li>MANY challenges exist, but specifically I am concerned that the change would negatively impact the community at our school/neighborhood given that the majority of the older students would be unable to walk to school. I think also we should consider how K-8 schools that provide an IB curriculum fit into this model - I would want to make sure the middle schools these children attend still have IB curriculum, as well as prioritizing students’ abilities to maintain relationships with their peers formed early in their school careers, especially in the middle school years when these relationships are so important.</li><li>Loss of families who like their current schools and go elsewhere for middle school. Unless we have a butler lab or cfi equivalent option, we’d personally go private.</li><li>As mentioned above- I’m not sure this model is a good one.</li><li>Would the school model continue on for the middle school? Ie would the middle schools be Montessori/CFI/Lab teaching style or would it be just normal education?</li><li>Where would the middle schools be located? Would more busing be available?</li><li>I see where IPS needs a lot of help in areas but reconfiguring proven successful models doesn’t seem like a great idea</li><li>If you don’t put a middle school in my neighborhood, I’ll send my kids somewhere else</li><li>The challenges that could arise would have to do with the SIZE of the 6-8 buildings. I love that CFI 2 is a small school. The teachers know my student and that matters when we think about relationship building. One way to navigate that would be to cohort kids within the building if it needs to be large, so that the same teachers would follow them through middle school.</li><li>I chose CFI because of the K8 model for this reason. I like the idea that there are only 2 classrooms per grade and that the middle school team knows the students so well. "</li><li>The challenge would be integrating students in specific magnet and innovation programs that don't have comparable/sister schools to move on to.</li><li>You lose the sense of community in the K-8 schools and the benefits to students having a smaller middle school program. In K-8 schools, there’s an opportunity for older students to work with younger ones. It fosters an opportunity for responsibility and role-modelling. I think more families would choose private schools over IPS middle schools, because making middle schools bigger would present more challenges socially for students and more behavior issues overall. Attainment would go down in the higher performing schools and then more families would leave IPS. IPS really needs to be careful as they move forward because they risk destroying the high performing and sought-after schools. Focus on hiring professionals and adjusting the support and work load so that teachers stay in the district. You can try to replicate programs and move things around, but if you can’t keep good teachers then none of it will matter.</li><li>Moving teachers and students</li><li>You are going to lose financial support from families. We will pull our children and funding from your school system if you take away the K-8 experience. I believe you've done this before and it didn't work out well for you. Learn your own history. I'm all for expanding the choice schools but leave Montessori schools alone. The K-8 experience is vital to their success.</li><li>You would weaken the sense of school community that is developed by the students in a K-8 setting. The older kids love to help the younger ones in the same way they were helped when they were younger. Students feel secure in a familiar setting and would be more confident in learning, taking risks, and being themselves. Leaving K-8 teaches the older students how to be leaders, and allows for more collaboration and continuity with teachers in the school. Studies show reading and math proficiencies fall for students that attend a middle school vs. a K-8 school.</li><li>Building space needs do not equal educational needs. Solving building space/quality problems in the district should not be done at the expense of quality of kids’ educational outcomes.</li><li>Taking kids out of buildings that are successful to place them in an environment that IPS has historically struggled with</li><li>Keeping k-8 empowers the higher grades to act as mentors for the younger children and allows for stronger/longer relationships between children and teachers. Faculty and staff really get to know the children and guide their development into young adults in a community. Realigning grades forces children to reestablish these relationships</li><li>It divides families. It would force many north side families to move their 6th graders to private schools or out of district.</li><li>Right now, both of my children go to the same school and one of the main reasons we picked CFI 2 is because it goes through 8th grade.</li><li>Moving current students to other school buildings, changing peer group.</li><li>The success of so many of these programs was built, not only by the curriculum but also by the community that supports the school. It is much easier for parents and students to feel engaged at a school where they feel like more than just a number and the smaller k- 8 schools allow for a greater connection to teachers and admin for parents and students. So many of the extracurricular activities and clubs didn’t immediately appear at these schools but rather we’re brought into the schools as the community and opportunity around the school grew. The idea that pulling these schools apart in order to replicate them seems inconsistent with the sense of community they created. I recognize that IPS is hampered by too few resources to build more programming on this small scale, but to change what is working with the idea of expanding it seems inconsistent with what is working in my opinion. I am grateful for the school, staff and teachers where my children attend.</li><li>families with multiple students having to deal with multiple schools logistics. breaking up the strong sense of community that k-8 fosters.</li><li>Many! SPED and most vulnerable students lives would abruptly be interrupted. Families would face instability in planning as many make school choices based on logistics. Younger students would lose the opportunity to interact with and learn from older students. Older students would lose the social emotional lessons of being with younger students. This decision will further push families outside of the district.</li><li>You're losing the school community and educational continuity that kids will have with K-8 schools. Also studies show that kids math and reading levels will drop. It seems quite likely that changing to middle school format would negatively effect our children education.</li><li>I have 2 students who will be at the same school for 4 years if it stays the same. Realignment will cause us to no longer be a part of IPS.</li><li>Potential for reassignment of schools. We made a choice to move homes for the purpose of locating near a specific school, and school reassignment to other locations would create undue and unforeseen challenges to families with multiple students and families that relied on attendance at a nearby school.</li><li>We are strong proponents of our children building community within their primary school from K-8. Students in IPS schools are already forced to switch communities twice (from daycare to primary and from primary to secondary). Adding a third change would further deteriorate the community aspect of the school network. It's important to note that surrounding districts often do not lose this community aspect because their districts are much, much smaller than IPS.</li><li>Research shows evidence of benefits for students in k-8 educational settings. There is no evidence from peer reviewed research which shows a benefit in separating middle school grades. In fact, there is some evidence that rates of discipline increase in middle school grade only schools. This type of change would negatively impact students who benefit from specialized programming at current charter and magnet programs. I am firmly against this proposed change.</li><li>Siblings</li><li>Students lose academic progress when they transition schools, especially at the middle school level (grade 6-8), when much of their energy is being focused on social development. Keeping students in a K-8 facility without uprooting their existing social support network allows them to expand their confidence and focus on academics. Further, teachers and staff can incorporate these Grade 6-8 students in leadership/mentoring roles for younger students, which not only allows them to apply their own understanding of academic concepts in a meaningful way, but boosts a spirit of community and cooperation in the school. Students who are allowed to take a mentorship role within the school are shown to be more focused, dedicated, and higher performing than their peers at Grade 6-8 facilities.</li><li>These kiddos have already had two years of unprecedented upheaval due to Covid. To throw in another transition within an already transitional period seems like it’s only going to create more setbacks from a learning standpoint.</li><li>I think it would cause a significant drop in the "community feeling" we currently get with the school…which is very important to the success of the school.</li><li>A major problem would be damaging the existing successful choice programs, which are K-8 models. Replicating existing successes should not include damaging those programs by removing the K-8 structure.</li><li>Unfortunately, I think this would be a huge detriment to IPS. I grew up in Indianapolis in the same neighborhood I live in now. I went to the parochial school across the street, IHM, instead of 84. My parents would not have sent me to 84 then, in large part because it was a 1-5/6 school. My mother was a teacher, and she knew how important both (1) continuity and (2) small schools for children were. Now grown, I have also been a public school teacher, as has my husband, and we agree.</li><li>Back then, but especially in today’s landscape, when the mental health crisis for our elementary and middle school children is surging out of control, keeping students among peers, teachers, and parents that they know and who have known them and their siblings for six+ years can mean the difference between a student slipping through the cracks or not. It can mean the difference between (a) a teacher or parent asking the prior year teacher or another parent who has been in the school for six years “what’s up with Jeremy?” and (b) no one noticing a significant behavioral change that could have a lasting effect on Jeremy’s life and, worst case scenario, his classmates’ lives if the worst were to happen. Anxiety rates are so high in today’s kids. Shifting them to a large middle school in which they have to re-make friends and have much less oversight from teachers and less interaction with parents is a recipe for making those rates soar. Not to mention that most parents are from dual working households in IPS. A change to middle school would mean a change from two siblings getting picked up and dropped off to only one sibling getting picked up and the other on the bus. It’s the difference between both parents getting to show up at the same school event or having to divide their time between the younger kid’s elementary school event and the older’s middle school event. It’s the difference in parent involvement at the school, since their time will be divided and they too will have to make new a parent community. It’s the difference between after school play dates with neighborhood school friends and not having the time to make the 20-minute drive both ways on a weeknight after work.</li><li>We were thrilled to obtain a lottery spot at School 84, we want to support Indianapolis public schools, and we sincerely hope that our children will both attend School 84 for 9 years each. My husband and I are both former public school teachers who will actively engage in our children’s school community. However, we are also outliers as public school parents in our current social networks. Most of our friends have chosen or will choose parochial schools or private schools in the city. Many of my friends who are still considering private vs public schools have pointed to the tight community of private/parochial k-8 schools, and I’ve been able to happily say “but school 84 is k-8!” and that actually makes them pause and consider the IPS system more seriously. And I understand their concerns. If I am being completely honest, a change from k-8 to k-5/6- 8 is important enough to my husband and I that it would be the decision maker between continuing at school 84 for 9+ years and switching to parochial/private next year when our oldest son is in 1st grade. For these reasons, I truly believe that changing schools to a k-5/6-8 model will make IPS lose families who have the option to choose to pay for parochial/private schools instead. What’s more, because of the school choice tax voucher laws in Indiana, I do believe that would adversely impact the IPS budget overall, which I understand is already in great distress.</li><li>For all of these reasons, I emphatically encourage IPS to keep its schools k-8. I encourage IPS to keep what is good and working in the successful IPS schools instead of making those schools less attractive by trying solutions (like k-5/6-8) that IPS tried in the past (90’s/early 2000’s) when those same currently successful schools were not nearly as successful as they are today.</li><li>A few years ago I was told the district was moving TO K-8 programs. We have now built some successful K-8 program only to dismantle them a few years later. I am not convinced it is because K-8 schools have been shown to have low performing 6-8th graders. I see a lot of benefits to the K-8 structure</li><li>Issues with a second lottery system in 5th grade</li><li>K-8 schools provide a consistent home base for kids, give kids opportunities for leadership, limit transitions (increasing ease for parents and kids), and have demonstrated positive academic and developmental outcomes.</li><li>Behavior, inconsistent curriculum</li><li>Our current K-8 model works. It would be very disruptive to the students that are currently in 6-8.</li><li>Why on Earth would we do this right after our children and teachers have just barely gotten through covid??!! If this is a long term plan based on evidence, then think about this in years to come after our children have recovered emotionally from covid.</li><li>This seems so blind to the current state of our world. I also imagine you’ll lose a lot of families in the process. Our kids have been through enough. They need less stress not more.</li><li>And why does it matter if we align with other districts?</li><li>It depends on how you would implement it. If it means that students would need a second lottery, that has a huge and damaging impact on families. The lottery is hard and stressful enough particularly with families with more than one student. If you had to reapply for middle school,, you would disrupt preexisting school relationships with the school itself, teachers, and students, uproot families, and lost any sense of community.</li><li>hardship on working parents in terms of multiple drop off/pick up locations. less mentorship opportunities for older kids and mentee opportunities for the younger kids.</li><li>I like the model of keeping students in the same building for longer. It's helpful for siblings and parents if they can stay in the same building for more years and have less transition.</li><li>Families with siblings will be separated sooner requiring transportation to different schools for at least three more years. Travel to middle school will likely be outside of schools close in proximity. Teachers will not know students as well if in much larger buildings - particularly concerning during those tricky middle school years.</li><li>Logistics. Confusion and issues with multi schools on one household.</li><li>K-8 schools are really wonderful - the presence of younger children along with older ones seems to keep the whole building unified, united, and calm. Older middle schoolers are happy to set examples and the little ones look up to the big kids. I would have more K-8 schools if possible.</li><li>For those of us with kids at various age levels &amp; making certain we can attend the events we need to (i.e. parent in touch conferences, extracurriculars, etc.) I am a near eastside resident, with kids who attend school in Glendale, and work on the far southside - so attending everything &amp; participation is often difficult to coordinate.</li><li>Loosing the community and consistency of the K-8 model</li><li>I think educating 11 to 14-year-olds is a bit of a challenge of some significance no matter what the structure. I worry that taking kids who have had one educational model for six years and then making them adjust to another model would create more challenges to an already challenging age. I also think that students benefit from being in community with kids who are older or younger and it would be a shame to lose that.</li><li>Chaos and Trauma for students that are benefitting from being a school where they are comfortable and supported. As a middle school parent, I have the option to send my child to Harshman middle. If the K-8 were low in enrollment in the middle school years and the middle schools were bursting at the seams this might make more sense. However, IB MYP starts in grade 6. Would this program be eliminated or moved into the middle school? As a parent of a recent Shortridge grad I would have an abundance of questions regarding the validity of this in a middle school.</li><li>As a former classroom teacher in a K-8, I witnessed the school culture being an incredible support for many middle schoolers. Those are hard years. Having teachers in the building with eyes on the middle school students fosters positive relationships and support structures for all students. Middle school students have leadership roles and often have a younger student that looks up to them and helps stabilize their unsteady sense of self.</li><li>If transitioning means applying again, kids could not be placed in an environment they are familiar with, or in a space that doesn’t know them.</li><li>There are SEVERAL as I see it. 1) Pulling resources away from K-5 programs that used to be K-8. 2) Decreasing/interrupting community built around K-8 neighborhood schools (the middle schools will likely see reduced parent-teacher engagement and reduced opportunities for schools who raise funds to meet gaps in IPS funding for important things like playground infrastructure, etc. 3) Isolating the middle school experience from elementary and separating siblings across more schools. It feels like the last 10 years IPS has pushed to close 6-8 middle schools and move towards a k-8 model. Why now are you trying to break those apart ?!? Constantly reshaping physical schools and curriculums is inefficient. It doesn't seem like the reasons IPS is pushing or pursuing this are being presented clearly. MORE TRANSPARENCY, even if its just about addressing choice or economics is necessary.</li><li>Changing plans of families who have relied on the current model.</li><li>Logistics of families with kids at different schools</li><li>Lose a great deal of the community in K-8 schools - younger grades look up to, enjoy and learn from the older grades being in the same building.</li><li>If grades are realigned we will no longer have: A Culture of Community, A K-8 culture is built on relationships with an emphasis on community being central to its culture. A Continuity of Parent Involvement A key indicator of student success is parent involvement, which remains steady in K-8 schools through the middle school years when it tends to drop off as students move from 5th grade to a separate middle school environment. Leadership Opportunities; When the expectation for 8th graders is to be role models for the rest of the school, they rise to the occasion. Waiting until high school delays the chance for students to grow and think as a leader. Students in K-8 schools can put leadership skills into practice at school wide events where middle schoolers act as buddies to their younger peers, Time to Discover Strengths: The K-8 student graduate has acquired a composite of leadership and personal experiences that allows him or her to transition to high school, many with interviews and application processes, with confidence. Academic and Social Success: “Top Dogs” Test scores may improve as well. In a study done by Dr. Robert Offenberg of Philadelphia tat compared outcomes of students who attended K-8 schools versus the traditional 6-8 environment, the results support K-8. SAT scores in reading, math and science are significantly stronger in K-8 schools. We committed to 91 for all these reasons above, and we have stayed at 91 despite long commualswe have heard such great things about the school’s nurturing of 7&amp; 8 graders. Please don't hurt our children in order to save a dollar.</li><li>money</li><li>It goes against the overwhelming consensus of educational research, as well as the evidence from your own successful schools (CFI, Butler Lab, etc.) which are all K-8 schools, and much more successful than your 6-8 schools. Instead, realign grades to create MORE K-8 buildings.</li><li>This move would tear apart community at current K-8 (or 2-8, as my kids' school does). The younger kids get mentoring and positive examples from middle school kids and the curricula are separate but bridged by common staffing, creating a cohesive experience. For my kids' part, I also fear that any specialized or high-ability delivery would suffer as dedicated middle schools wouldn't have the resources to meet needs of a range of student abilities. Consolidating abilities in larger middle schools would result in teachers being preoccupied with managing behavior and struggling to meet needs of underprepared students while high-ability students received poorer and less dedicated instruction. If IPS goes ahead with this plan, I know Sidener Academy will suffer because it's a 2-8 school and seems ripe for some unfavorable approach that sacrifices its legacy of instruction and nurturing IPS's brightest minds. This would be a grave error on IPS's part.</li><li>You would remove s large portion of the models established in high performance schools like CFI. How in the world would the gifted students at Sidner still even have a school? It's a short sided idea that will abandon the model that works for IPS high performance schools. There is zero functional need to align with nearby districts.</li><li>Change is always hard. However, our nearby districts have 6-8 buildings and IPS should have middle school options for all students. It doesn’t make sense to have some students attend a middle school and others attend a K-8.</li><li>The middle school model not proving to be beneficial. Splitting up younger kids with older kids prohibits them from learning from one another. Also splitting up siblings that could go to the same school for years together.</li><li>I see no challenge</li><li>Children’s SEL and sense of belonging</li><li>There's a lot more than one. I would be upset if this happened because I am looking forward to being an 8th grader at my school. If I had to go to a middle school I would miss my class trip and walking to school with my friends and being able to try for the lead in the musical and 8th grade promotion with my small class and other fun events that we get to do. I don't think this is a good idea because all of us are comfortable where we are and it would really ruin everything. If you want to change the school then you need to do it in phases - like only send 6th grade the first year and then add a grade each year so that current middle school kids aren't affected. I love my school and would hate it if it changed. I only want to make a change when I go to high school and not before that.</li><li>It's not fair to take the middle school kids out of their building when they aren't expecting that. It would be really hard to adjust to a new place right before I had to do that for high school too. It would also mean that sports would probably have try-outs and some people wouldn't make the team which is why a lot of my friends like IPS sports because we can all play even if they aren't really good. Where would you put the building? I don't want to ride a bus. I like that my school is where I can walk or ride my bike. I don't think a lot of teachers will want to move into the new building either. I think they are happy where they are and would just leave which would be terrible because we have great teachers. This change would need to be done slowly to make it work because I think you will have a lot of angry people if you try to do it like next year. I don't think it's a good idea at all though. I don't see why we need to change what we have. Our k-8 school is awesome.</li><li>It would be a really big school with a lot of kids. I like my small school.</li><li>Kids have to transition to an extra school instead of staying at one they know through their younger years.</li><li>Picking up siblings if in different buildings</li><li>This creates real heartburn for me. What is the problem we are trying to correct? We have been sending our daughter out of district because we could not get into the school 0.55 miles from our house until this upcoming school year. A benefit of changing schools now that she is in (and with her brother still out of district) is that we don't have to worry about where she is going for grades 6-8. Now this might go away? Will we have to re-enter a lottery to get into the middle school closest to our house because that is the only answer IPS can come up with to provide opportunity to all? When talking to our daughter about switching schools she noted that her classmates at her old school lived near each other and could play in the evenings and weekends and she would finally know what that feels like. Please stop the nonsense and come up with solutions to better other schools rather than forcing kids to schools not in their neighborhoods.</li><li>None. This would be best for everyone!</li><li>Staffing. Period. If we realign the grades we have to find someone to fill in all of the gaps and that can be hard.</li><li>Six Graders need to be isolated from 7th and 8 th graders. There should be a 6th grade hallway where the 6th graders change classes.</li><li>Staff and family resistance to change</li><li>Lack of continuity between elementary and middle school curricula, losing families to private schools, potential loss of IB status for middle school</li><li>sixth graders are not ready for middle school.</li><li>Specific programs work when a school is k-8. The older students help out the younger ones. I think losing the k-8 model would be a mistake, I would bet the current schools using this model have higher performing middle school test scores. Why change something that has worked just to be like other districts?</li><li>Staff reconfiguration. I currently teach 5th and 6th grade. I may be displaced if reconfigured. This is at a time, when it is hard for IPS to get highly qualified leachers like myself.</li><li>I think one major challenge which can not be understated is community attachment to schools. Closing schools, realigning schools, moving students, is always a hot button issue which brings up a lot of emotions. We need to ensure we consider the needs and wishes of our community and involve them in the process of making these decisions, which I feel we are on track with this already. As an educator in IPS as well as a resident of the district, I appreciate that my feedback is solicited as we move forward as TeamIPS.</li><li>Older siblings won’t be on hand for younger siblings.</li><li>Many neighborhood schools have large families that all attend the same school, and this will split them up, which can be challenging for parents.</li><li>may mean shutting smaller schools</li><li>Behavior. You will also lose sidener academy, which does nothing but great things for IPS. You must test into that school. Where would IPS’s test scores be without the full high ability school? Also, many teachers can’t move south or west. Leave sidener alone, but add to programs, such as the CFI schools. Have not heard good things about the butler lab middle grades.</li><li>For families? After school care.</li><li>Staffing, IPS already has a staffing retention difficulty.</li><li>Many of the programs you claim are successful and that you want to replicate, are in fact K-8 buildings, and the idea of k-8 is a foundational part of those programs. If you want to replicate those programs, simultaneously changing the grade alignment at those buildings will be a very steep challenge for staff. Replicating programs is already very difficult to do successfully, and adding a foundational change to how those schools models work may result in higher staff turnover due to stress and lack of resources to do so successfully.</li><li>The K-8 models allow the older children to support the younger children with programs like Book Buddies, where older students read with younger ones. The K-8 model seems to make the social challenges of middle school less intense.</li><li>Too many middle schoolers in one place is tough to handle. I’m a middle school teacher at Butler Lab 55 and strongly believe in the K-8 model. It builds school spirit, little kids look up to big kids, it helps adults to see middle schoolers as kids still. I would more than likely find a job outside of IPS or outside of middle school if this change were to be made.</li><li>There aren’t established middle schools for some of the choice schools. Also, as students develop in the community of their K-8, they can be great models for the younger students. They also have respect for their school because they value the program they are apart of. Will more teachers need to be hired for middle schools to have all the specials teachers and grade level teachers they have in K-8? Will there be a new middle school lottery? Will students need to travel further to attend a new middle school?</li><li>They have failed in the past. Parents want options, but they also want k-8 buildings. Some of our most successful middle school performances are in these k-8 buildings where support and instruction are more defined and meet the needs of individuals. I am STRONGLY opposed to taking away middle school from our K-8 programs.</li><li>Would have to go through lottery again for middle school; kids would likely be split from friends at a time when peers are becoming more important to development; kids would have to change curriculum styles unnecessarily, as opposed to maintaining consistent learning for a longer period</li><li>Moving children who are already in K-8 schools will disrupt progress in existing schools and potentially split up siblings.</li><li>I think the K-8 Model is great. It allows little kids to learn from big ones and vice versa. It teaches empathy and gives mentoring opportunities. It would be a shame to get rid of it.</li><li>The students who are already in MS in a K-8 building</li><li>This greatly impacts community feel at each school, challenges for families with children at multiple schools, time for transition, concerns of many families leaving the district with this change.</li><li>ensuring students with the same learning platform and performance level are consolidated in the middle school setting; not creating a long commute</li><li>Buildings space and school changes.</li><li>A middle school needs to be opened on the southside.</li><li>Losing continuity of community in support of students as they transition into the social and academic challenges of middle school</li><li>One more transportation need for families with more than one student.</li><li>Many students will have to move schools</li><li>The data shows that K-8 schools have a higher retention rate. the fact that 91 is a K-8 school is the main reason we stayed there when we moved out of district. Keeping kids with their friends during that developmental phase supports better mental health. I am a developmental specialist and would strongly encourage the district to look at the data on mental health outcomes in a K-8 setting versus a 6-8 setting.</li></ul>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Our four high schools are pioneers in the State of Indiana, serving as College and Career Academies with coursework and programming built to help students explore specific college and career opportunities.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">Our student-centered approach begins with guided planning for post-graduation in our summer bridge program, before students even start high school.

And every student completes a capstone project or experience in line with their college or career goals.</p>

<p>Indianapolis Public Schools provides alternative settings for students who may need a nontraditional school environment. The alternative programs provide support in the following areas: academic acceleration; social/emotional skill building; and behavioral strategies and techniques. Students are engaged in many skill-building activities, which enhance their ability to make good choices and become productive citizens. The alternative programs are individualized and meet the needs of specific populations that are identified as requiring additional intervention. Each program’s mission serves a unique range of needs that vary from accelerating student completion of multiple grade levels in one year to an alternative to expulsion, based on the hearing officer’s determination.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Positive School Climate and Culture Services within Indianapolis Public Schools encompasses issues such as the physical and emotional safety of students, health and well-being, the orderliness of classrooms and public spaces, and/or the degree to which a school embraces and celebrates racial, ethnic, linguistic or cultural diversity. We believe thinking and learning should be the focus; any and all roadblocks to that end should be intentionally removed through a healthy school climate and culture.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Positive School Culture &amp; Practices Coordinators collaborate with school, district, county, community organizations and stakeholders to advance supports and interventions for all students in IPS. Our staff provides training, assistance, monitoring and policy development by working collaboratively with districtwide staff and the community at large.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Our coordinators also facilitate the ongoing development and maintenance of restorative justice practices and social-emotional learning districtwide. We collaboratively build systems that address behaviors, strengthen relationships and focus on empathy, as well as building the&nbsp;social skills necessary for academic and life-long success. We also train, develop, implement and maintain positive behavioral interventions and supports at the student, classroom, schoolwide and district levels.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (PBIS) is training and support on a systemic implementation of a decision-making framework for positive social culture in a school or district. PBIS is a decision-making framework that guides selection, integration and implementation of the best evidence-based behavioral practices for improving important behavior outcomes for all students. PBIS is not a curriculum, intervention or practice, but instead is a collaboration between district and school staff in designing behavioral support systems at each tier of a Multi-Tier System of Supports (MTSS).</p>

<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Restorative Practices</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Restorative practices uses restorative justice principles to create alternative dispute resolutions as well as foster empathy, accountability and restoration of fairness to victims and community in IPS. Educators and school children are being trained to use these skills to work with other students and families to resolve conflicts and restore justice in an effort to end violence and bullying in our schools and the school-to-prison&nbsp;“Pipeline to Prison.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Social Emotional Learning (SEL)</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Social-emotional learning (SEL) is the process through which children and adults acquire and effectively apply the knowledge, attitudes and skills necessary to understand and manage emotions, set and achieve positive goals, feel and show empathy for others, establish and maintain positive relationships, and make responsible decisions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Often taught in the classroom, social-emotional learning gives tomorrow’s workforce the tools for success while educators find it contributes to a positive school climate and increased academic success. Beyond immediate outcomes in the classroom, SEL prepares employees to solve problems, manage emotions and communicate.</p>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Playworks</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Playworks is a districtwide initiative that focuses on positive behavioral interactions between students and staff during recess time. Moreover, it believes in the power of play to bring out the best in every child. Playworks creates a place for every child on the playground. It doesn’t matter if children have never learned or played games before. They ensure our children have a place that is safe and welcoming — where they can play, thrive and contribute. The primary goal of Playworks is that every child takes this positive experience back to the classroom and back to their communities. We are working toward full implementation at each of our elementary school sites in the very near future.</p>

Our staff provides training, assistance and monitoring, as well as policy development, by working collaboratively with districtwide staff and the community at large.<br />
Our coordinators also facilitate the ongoing development and maintenance of restorative justice practices and social-emotional learning districtwide. We collaboratively build systems that address behaviors, strengthen relationships and focus on empathy, as well as building the social skills necessary for academic and life-long success. We also train, develop, implement and maintain positive behavioral interventions and supports at the student, classroom, schoolwide and district levels.<br />

It doesn&#8217;t matter if children have never learned or played games before. They ensure our children have a place that is safe and welcoming &#8212; where they can play, thrive and contribute. The primary goal of Playworks is that every child takes this positive experience back to the classroom and back to their communities.

The SCC is important for all members of the school community to read and understand. When all partners know, understand and follow the SCC, they help ensure schools are respectful and productive places for all students to learn at high levels.<br />
The SCC applies to students at all times during the school day, while on school property (including before- and after-school programs), while traveling to and from school (including bus stops), at any school-related event, and when students use the district’s electronic network services.<br />

<p>The goal of IPS is NOT to expel students, but to surround them with positive behavioral supports that assist each student in having a successful school career. However, if a student has an incident or exhibits ongoing inappropriate behaviors that warrant implementation of the expulsion process, the school administration will generate a request for expulsion. When this happens, the school notifies the parent of the expulsion process. The Indianapolis Public Schools Hearing Officer will contact the parent via mail as to the next steps. This letter contains vital information, so it is imperative to watch the mail closely and follow the directions the letter gives. This ensures that IPS provides the best support possible for all students.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Army JROTC (Junior Reserve Officers Training Corps) has a long and proud tradition of service to the nation through the betterment of its youth. Founded as part of the National Defense Act of 1916, subsequent legislation opened the program to the other military services and made it an integral part of the school curriculum. This legislation also recognized JROTC instructors as qualified Instructors in “leadership, wellness, fitness and civics, as well as other courses related to the content of the program.” Public and private educational institutions apply for JROTC units and commit to share costs and meet standards. At any given time there are 200 high schools on a waitlist for JROTC programs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>JROTC in IPS dates to 1919 when a program was first established at Arsenal Technical High School. The Tech program has been in continuous service ever since. Currently there are active Army JROTC programs at:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Arsenal Tech High School.</li><li>Crispus Attucks High School.</li><li>George Washington High School.</li><li>Shortridge High School.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A minimum of 100 cadets in Grades 9–12 organized into a cadet chain of command make up a JROTC unit. Two instructors, normally consisting of one retired officer (the Senior Army Instructor, or SAI) and one noncommissioned officer (the Army Instructor or AI) teach a rigorous curriculum and supervise cadets in all their activities. The Army reimburses IPS for a percentage of instructor pay and provides uniforms, equipment and an accredited and rigorous curriculum. High schools in 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, Japan, Korea and Germany currently host more than 1,700 JROTC units, employ approximately 4,000 instructors and enroll nearly 300,000 cadets, almost half of whom are females.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>JROTC is not a recruitment program for the military. Cadets do not incur any military obligation, and instructors do not apply any pressure toward military service. However, cadets who choose to enlist or enter Senior ROTC may receive benefits through higher rank or advancement.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>JROTC in IPS is far more than “marching around the gym” and posting the colors at a school ceremony. It is a tremendous, all-inclusive program for students of all abilities and backgrounds. It is recognized not only for its extremely positive effect on cadets, but also for its powerful impact on the school and community within its sphere of influence. JROTC is a large, popular, 21st Century Learning Program that:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Features a world-class curriculum that employs student-centered learning and enhances program popularity.</li><li>Teaches citizenship and leadership roles and subjects that align to national and state standards.</li><li>Integrates current instructional and technology strategies and maximizes award winning multimedia curriculum.</li><li>Hosts quality competitions to motivate cadets.</li><li>Demonstrates the ultimate model of diversity.</li><li>Provides training for a pathway to the miltary at all IPS high schools.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Contact Information</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For additional information about JROTC, contact retired&nbsp;Col. Jerry Hadley, IPS JROTC Director of Army Instruction, at 317.226.3915 or&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hadleyge@myips.org">hadleyge@myips.org.</a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Mission and Curriculum</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The focus of Army JROTC is reflected in its mission, <strong>“To motivate young people to be better citizens.”</strong> JROTC accomplishes this mission by providing educational opportunities and lifelong skills to America’s youth. The <strong>Character Education Partnership</strong> identifies programs that build character as those with less violence, higher self-esteem, less absenteeism, higher achievement scores and academic performance, greater connections to school, engagement in lessons, and commitment to success. <strong>JROTC is such a program.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The curriculum helps cadets develop lifelong leadership and decision making skills. These attributes are exhibited on a daily basis in the cadet chain of command and set a model for the student body to emulate. In IPS, cadets take JROTC as an elective class on a daily basis, Monday through Friday, and on one of those days they are required to wear the JROTC uniform. Incoming freshmen cadets can receive credit for physical education through participation in JROTC. The curriculum supports the school’s mission and mandates by integrating technology, linking content to state standards, integrating reading and writing, and providing character and financial education. In a recent evaluation that led to accreditation by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS), the quality assurance review team noted, “… [JROTC] serves to reinforce the competencies taught in the other academic subjects in which students are enrolled.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Instructors, Mentors, Leaders and Coaches</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>JROTC instructors in IPS have completed at least 20 years of military service and set an outstanding example of personal behavior, professional etiquette and appearance for cadets, colleagues and the community. They perform full time as teachers and after school they are the equivalent of coaches whose teams are always in season. After-school activities are open to all cadets and include rifle team, color guard, drill team and raider team. Major instructor responsibilities are to continuously improve instruction, provide a safe and supportive environment, mentor, coach and practice strategies to motivate cadets to learn and succeed in high school and in life. Instructors stay abreast of new and alternative instructional and motivational techniques, use the latest technology and interactive multimedia available, and provide an awareness of world cultures and history, as well as possible careers. They reinforce the curriculum through service learning and co-curricular activities after school and on weekends. Administrators, counselors and teachers rely on them to set standards and provide support. JROTC instructors provide an overall blanket of visible leadership. They can be counted on to be team players in solving problems, assisting with school programs and initiatives, and helping other teachers in many arenas.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Cadets: The Future</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> IPS JROTC cadets set the example by being active in the community as well as in their schools. They exemplify a tremendous work ethic and standard that increases the expectations of all. They serve as role models to the other students in the school. They are not just talking about achievement, service to the community and filling leadership roles -– they are doing it. Cadets know how to set goals as well as how to develop and follow a plan to reach them. They are willing to help others do the same. Our cadets tutor. They conduct food drives and visit veterans at the VA Hospital. They work in middle and elementary schools to assist younger students to learn about character and team building and to provide an example for them to emulate. They participate in academic, marksmanship, drill, physical fitness and leadership competitions, as well as in a demanding annual summer camp at Camp Atterbury. Instructors and cadets visibly exemplify pride, patriotism, high standards and increased expectations. Both instructors and cadets are seen as resources because of their knowledge of conflict resolution, emergency action responses, leadership, teamwork and emotional intelligence. Although the cadets do not have a military obligation after graduation, successful completion of JROTC while in high school allows those that enlist in the military to do so at an advanced pay grade, enhancing their military pathway and career.<br></p>

					Army JROTC (Junior Reserve Officers Training Corps) has a long and proud tradition of service to the nation through the betterment of its youth. Founded as part of the National Defense Act of 1916, subsequent legislation opened the program to the other military services and made it an integral part of the school curriculum. This legislation also recognized JROTC instructors as qualified Instructors in “leadership, wellness, fitness and civics, as well as other courses related to the content of the program.” Public and private educational institutions apply for JROTC units and commit to share costs and meet standards. At any given time there are 200 high schools on a waitlist for JROTC programs.<br />
JROTC in IPS dates to 1919 when a program was first established at Arsenal Technical High School. The Tech program has been in continuous service ever since. Currently there are active Army JROTC programs at:</p>
<p>Arsenal Tech High School.<br />
Crispus Attucks High School.<br />
George Washington High School.<br />
Shortridge High School.</p>
<p>A minimum of 100 cadets in Grades 9–12 organized into a cadet chain of command make up a JROTC unit. Two instructors, normally consisting of one retired officer (the Senior Army Instructor, or SAI) and one noncommissioned officer (the Army Instructor or AI) teach a rigorous curriculum and supervise cadets in all their activities. The Army reimburses IPS for a percentage of instructor pay and provides uniforms, equipment, and an accredited and rigorous curriculum. High schools in 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, Japan, Korea and Germany currently host more than 1,700 JROTC units, employ approximately 4,000 instructors and enroll nearly 300,000 cadets, almost half of whom are females.<br />
JROTC is not a recruitment program for the military. Cadets do not incur any military obligation, and instructors do not apply any pressure toward military service. However, cadets who choose to enlist or enter Senior ROTC may receive benefits through higher rank or advancement.<br />
JROTC in IPS is far more than “marching around the gym” and posting the colors at a school ceremony. It is a tremendous, all-inclusive program for students of all abilities and backgrounds. It is recognized not only for its extremely positive effect on cadets, but also for its powerful impact on the school and community within its sphere of influence. JROTC is a large, popular, 21st Century Learning Program that:</p>
<p>Features a world-class curriculum that employs student-centered learning and enhances program popularity.<br />
Teaches citizenship and leadership roles and subjects that align to national and state standards.<br />
Integrates current instructional and technology strategies and maximizes award winning multimedia curriculum.<br />
Hosts quality competitions to motivate cadets.<br />
Demonstrates the ultimate model of diversity.<br />
Provides training for a pathway to the miltary at all IPS high schools.</p>

					The focus of Army JROTC is reflected in its mission, “To motivate young people to be better citizens.&#8221; JROTC accomplishes this mission by providing educational opportunities and lifelong skills to America’s youth. The Character Education Partnership identifies programs that build character as those with less violence; higher self-esteem; less absenteeism; higher achievement scores and academic performance; more connected to school; engaged in lessons; and committed to success. JROTC is such a program.<br />
The curriculum helps cadets develop lifelong leadership and decision making skills. These attributes are exhibited on a daily basis in the cadet chain of command and set a model for the student body to emulate. In IPS, cadets take JROTC as an elective class on a daily basis, Monday through Friday, and on one of those days they are required to wear the JROTC uniform. Incoming freshmen cadets can receive credit for physical education through participation in JROTC. The curriculum supports the school’s mission and mandates by integrating technology, linking content to state standards, integrating reading and writing, and providing character and financial education. In a recent evaluation that led to accreditation by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS), the quality assurance review team noted, “… [JROTC] serves to reinforce the competencies taught in the other academic subjects in which students are enrolled.”

					JROTC instructors in IPS have completed at least 20 years of military service and set an outstanding example of personal behavior, professional etiquette and appearance for cadets, colleagues and the community. They perform full time as teachers and after school they are the equivalent of coaches whose teams are always in season. After-school activities are open to all cadets and include rifle team, color guard, drill team and raider team. Major instructor responsibilities are to continuously improve instruction, provide a safe and supportive environment, mentor, coach and practice strategies to motivate cadets to learn and succeed in high school and in life. Instructors stay abreast of new and alternative instructional and motivational techniques, use the latest technology and interactive multimedia available, and provide an awareness of world cultures and history, as well as possible careers. They reinforce the curriculum through service learning and co-curricular activities after school and on weekends. Administrators, counselors and teachers rely on them to set standards and provide support. JROTC instructors provide an overall blanket of visible leadership. They can be counted on to be team players in solving problems, assisting with school programs and initiatives, and helping other teachers in many arenas.

					IPS JROTC cadets set the example by being active in the community as well as in their schools. They exemplify a tremendous work ethic and standard that increases the expectations of all. They serve as role models to the other students in the school. They are not just talking about achievement, service to the community and filling leadership roles -– they are doing it. Cadets know how to set goals as well as how to develop and follow a plan to reach them. They are willing to help others do the same. Our cadets tutor. They conduct food drives and visit veterans at the VA Hospital. They work in middle and elementary schools to assist younger students to learn about character and team building and to provide an example for them to emulate. They participate in academic, marksmanship, drill, physical fitness and leadership competitions, as well as in a demanding annual summer camp at Camp Atterbury. Instructors and cadets visibly exemplify pride, patriotism, high standards and increased expectations. Both instructors and cadets are seen as resources because of their knowledge of conflict resolution, emergency action responses, leadership, teamwork, emotional intelligence, and their very presence. Although the cadets do not have a military obligation after graduation, successful completion of JROTC while in high school allows those that enlist in the military to do so at an advanced pay grade, enhancing their military pathway and career.

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Warning (10-17 days):</strong>&nbsp;Students who are absent an average of 15 days a year miss a year’s worth of school before their senior year. When students miss a day of school it actually puts them two days behind their classmates.</li>

As such, students and their parents/guardians hold the primary responsibility in determining a student’s personal attire, hairstyle, jewelry and personal items (e.g. backpacks, book bags) according to the IPS dress code. Schools are responsible for ensuring that student attire, hairstyle, jewelry and personal items do not interfere with the health or safety of any student and do not contribute to a hostile or intimidating environment for any student. Students, parents and staff continue to share stories of the benefits of the dress code – from spending less money on clothing to enjoying stress-free mornings when preparing for school. Students are to be dressed in appropriate attire beginning the first day of the school year.</p>

<h2><strong>Purpose of Dress Code Modification</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The IPS student dress code has been modified to eliminate barriers of students attending school, while providing families with the most cost effective options to meet the district dress code policy. Our new standard dress code will ensure that students are dressed appropriately for school and that we provide a laser focus on instruction and not attire.</p>

<p> Indianapolis Public Schools believes positive and safe schools support student achievement and high levels of teaching. The Student Code of Conduct sets the standards for student and adult behavior. It outlines rights, responsibilities and consequences for inappropriate behavior.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Student Code of Conduct (SCC) is important for all members of the school community to read and understand. When all partners know, understand and follow the SCC, they help ensure schools are respectful and productive places for all students to learn at high levels.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The SCC applies to students at all times during the school day, while on school property (including before and after school programs), while traveling to and from school (including bus stops), at any school-related event and when students use the district’s electronic network services.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Title IX is a federal law that prohibits gender based discrimination. IPS also has specific policy that prohibits gender based discrimination. Title IX protections apply to staff and students in our IPS community. Regulations issued by the federal government detail what qualifies as harassment or discrimination and how schools must respond. Gender based discrimination behaviors could include sexual misconduct, dating abuse or violence and gender identity harassment.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To inform our students, families and staff the IPS policy, administrative guidelines and available resources are provided here.</p>

<p>Creating an IPS community where student outcomes cannot be predicted by race or ethnicity is the vision of the Racial Equity Initiative (REI). The mission is to lead a collaboration of community members who will partner with IPS to improve outcomes for all students by eliminating racial disproportionality and disparity.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>REI Purpose</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In order to prepare IPS employees to meet the needs of students, the district embarked on an initiative around racial equity. By partnering with the Racial Equity Institute in 2015, IPS is able to receive the training and guidance needed to increase staff knowledge, shift thinking and elevate understanding.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Training provided by REI engages administrators, teachers, parents, support staff and community members. The work includes establishing active School Equity Teams (SET) who partner with the District Equity Team (DEI) to:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Participate in monthly planning meetings to develop measurable goals</li><li>Engage in book/workbook study groups</li><li>Review disaggregated academic and discipline data</li><li>Understand racism in all its forms, including how/when/where it occurs at all levels of the school community, even without intent</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Teachers and administrators transfer what they are learning through REI training into the classrooms. The hope is to bring this important work to a wider audience of teachers throughout IPS, helping this new audience, as well as longtime teacher-partners, apply what they know about equity literacy and restorative practices to the district’s racial equity efforts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The initiative’s anti-racism effort has proven to be so impactful in our district that the IPS Board of School Commissioners agreed during the 2018-19 school year to extend the work of the REI.</p>

<h1>Recommended Resources and Readings</h1>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of the best strategies for examining and understanding how to reach and teach a diverse student population is to become literate about who they are, where they come from and the gifts they bring with them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Study groups are recommended for this purpose and to give colleagues opportunities to share perspectives and experiences that have proven successful in the classroom, home or in other diverse environments.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

				<h2 class="et_pb_toggle_title">Our Core Commitments &amp; Beliefs</h2>
				<div class="et_pb_toggle_content clearfix">
					Adopted by the IPS Board of School Commissioners on March 9, 2015</p>
<p>All IPS students can achieve their full potential, learn at high levels, and graduate prepared to succeed in school, career and life.</p>
<p>Preparation for success in college, career and life requires academic achievement, self and social awareness, life‐long learning skills, and hard work.<br />
Success includes positively contributing to our society and participating in civic life.<br />
It is immoral to allow race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status to limit student achievement.<br />
Providing many school choice options helps families find the school best matched to their child’s talents, needs, interests, and unique learning styles.</p>
<p>Effective teachers and great schools are the key to students’ success.</p>
<p>The student‐teacher relationship drives success.<br />
Effective teachers have the power to make decisions in the best interest of their students, and they take responsibility for student learning.<br />
Every school has an effective principal.<br />
Quality schools set clear expectations and high standards for all students.</p>
<p>All IPS schools must be great places to teach and great places to learn.</p>
<p>Effective teachers and principals are valued professionals.<br />
Teachers and principals control and are accountable for what happens in their schools, and have the power to make decisions in the best interest of the students they serve.<br />
Students learn best in schools that are safe, clean, nurturing and respectful environments.<br />
Schools are diverse, vibrant and welcoming communities with strong academic, co‐curricular, and extracurricular opportunities.</p>
<p>The IPS Central Administration exists solely to support the work of teachers and schools, and must be a high‐performing organization.</p>
<p>All district functions are aligned to support and empower a system of autonomous schools that are held accountable to clear performance metrics.<br />
The district demonstrates diversity, innovation and best practice at all levels of the organization.<br />
District resources are allocated fairly and equitably among schools through the use of weighted student funding.<br />
The district maintains efficient instructional and business systems that operate in a transparent and ethical way.</p>
<p>IPS families and the entire Indianapolis community have a shared responsibility for student success and will benefit from this success.</p>
<p>Families are our students’ first teachers, and schools provide a range of ways for them to participate in the education of their children.<br />
We seek opportunities to connect schools, students, and families with services and other community/cultural assets.<br />
We seek involvement and investment by all stakeholders in the community to broaden our students’ experiences and opportunities to engage in our city, state, and beyond.<br />
Every family in Indianapolis has access to a high quality school regardless of where they live.</p>

We’re delighted to give our schools the opportunity to give all teachers the support, on-the-job learning, leadership opportunities, and higher pay they deserve.<br />
Opportunity Culture: Excellence Matters<br />
Excellent teacher leaders create a positive multiplier effect in teaching and student learning outcomes. Excellent teachers make approximately three times (3X) the progress of others. Students with excellent teachers make well over a year of progress each year. <br />
Indianapolis Public Schools is the first district in the state of Indiana to develop an Opportunity Culture.  An Opportunity Culture model leverages the impact of excellent teachers and their teams by reaching more students, paying excellent teachers more and designing an innovative teacher leadership model.<br />
Investing in excellent teachers transforms schools, creates empowered teams of educators and positively impacts teaching and student learning outcomes in the city of Indianapolis.<br />

<p><strong>Currently, IPS is only accepting research requests from two groups of researchers:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>IPS staff members who are working on their thesis or dissertation at universities</strong></li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Existing partner organizations with IPS who have sponsors or collaborators within IPS</strong></li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>We are not accepting research requests from individuals who do not meet the criteria above.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>IPS receives many requests to supply information for or to participate in research projects conducted by individuals or agencies from within and outside the school system. Requests will be reviewed by a research committee. The committee will include the administrators whose schools or programs are involved, and appropriate others. Recommendations are submitted for final approval to the Superintendent or his/her designee.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Approval of requests will depend on the value to IPS, with respect to the time of pupils and staff concerned, and the adequacy and acceptability of the design and instrumentation of the study.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Research must be conducted according to the highest ethical and methodological standards to protect the rights and privacy of our students and staff.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The following processes are to be followed and conditions met for applications to conduct research in the schools to be approved:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>An Indianapolis Public Schools Request to Conduct Research form must be completed (Please see link to forms below).</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>A detailed description of the methodology, procedures and objectives must be submitted with the form. If a specific site is desired, it should be identified in the proposal.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>One copy each of all instruments, including surveys, questionnaires and pictures, to be used must be included with the request. Copies of information letters and consent forms to be used must also be included.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Evidence of favorable human subjects, reviewed by the researcher’s institution, must be submitted with the request (IRB).</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The privacy of schools and individuals must be observed along with confidentiality of records. Researchers may inspect or review a pupil’s record or use any information contained in it only with written permission from the parent/guardian. The researcher must also sign the appropriate form giving his/her name, date of the review, and purpose of the review. This form becomes a permanent part of the pupil record.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Other personally identifiable records or files may be used only with written permission from the parent or guardian. Personality tests, personal problem checklists and similar instruments are not to be administered except with explicit consent of the parent or guardian.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If more than one researcher is to be involved in a study, one person should be assigned as the primary investigator and contact person.</p>

		<wp:meta_value><![CDATA[IPS receives many requests to supply information for or to participate in research projects conducted by individuals or agencies from within and outside the school system. Requests will be reviewed by a research committee. The committee will include the administrators whose schools or programs are involved, and appropriate others. Recommendations are submitted for final approval to the Superintendent or his/her designee.

Approval of requests will depend on the value to IPS, with respect to the time of pupils and staff concerned, and the adequacy and acceptability of the design and instrumentation of the study.

Research must be conducted according to the highest ethical and methodological standards to protect the rights and privacy of our students and staff.

The following processes are to be followed and conditions met for applications to conduct research in the schools to be approved:
<ol>
 	<li>An Indianapolis Public Schools Request to Conduct Research form must be completed (Please see link to forms below).</li>
 	<li>A detailed description of the methodology, procedures and objectives must be submitted with the form. If a specific site is desired, it should be identified in the proposal.</li>
 	<li>One copy each of all instruments, including surveys, questionnaires and pictures, to be used must be included with the request. Copies of information letters and consent forms to be used must also be included.</li>
 	<li>Evidence of favorable human subjects, reviewed by the researcher’s institution, must be submitted with the request (IRB).</li>
</ol>
The privacy of schools and individuals must be observed along with confidentiality of records. Researchers may inspect or review a pupil’s record or use any information contained in it only with written permission from the parent/guardian. The researcher must also sign the appropriate form giving his/her name, date of the review, and purpose of the review. This form becomes a permanent part of the pupil record.

Other personally identifiable records or files may be used only with written permission from the parent or guardian. Personality tests, personal problem checklists and similar instruments are not to be administered except with explicit consent of the parent or guardian.

If more than one researcher is to be involved in a study, one person should be assigned as the primary investigator and contact person.

Participation by students or employees is entirely voluntary. The schools or employees selected to participate in the study will be notified of the research committee’s approval of the study. It will be necessary for the researcher to secure cooperation from the participants.

A complete report of the study must be submitted upon completion to the Director of Research, Evaluation and Assessment of Indianapolis Public Schools. Interim reports may be required for studies extending beyond the school year in which the study was approved. Where group data is concerned (as in a report of a study), the parents/guardians of any student shall be entitled to receive, or be informed of, that part of such record or data that pertains to their children.

If you would like to conduct research within the district, please complete and submit the following forms:

<p>IPS recognizes that our responsibility to students extends far beyond the moment that they walk across the stage and receive their diplomas. The vision for all IPS graduates is to become enrolled in a college or university, employed at a livable wage or enlisted in one of the branches of the military. This has been designated as the IPS 3E Vision.</p>

<p>To support the IPS 3E Vision, IPS has implemented various Choice Options within the high schools that lead to multiple pathways, programs and supports including:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>All-Choice High School Model: </strong>This model includes Academies, Pathways, Career and Technical Education (CTE)&nbsp;and work-based learning experiences aligned with high-wage, high-demand industries and the expansion of rigorous college preparatory options.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Future Centers Located in Each High School:</strong> These centers are physical spaces with dedicated staff that provide programming and wrap-around services aimed at increasing the number of students completing high school and preparing students for postsecondary options. Future Centers support graduates during their 13th year with persistence programming and supports so that graduates successfully transition and persist in their chosen 3E plan.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>School Counseling Services</strong>: ASCA’s (American School Counselor Association) Data Driven Platform drives the practices for all IPS Counselors in grades K-12 as they support all students in the areas of academic achievement, social/emotional development and career exploration, which ensures all students are prepared to be Enrolled, Enlisted or Employed — thus becoming productive, well-adjusted citizens of tomorrow.&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>JROTC:</strong> The Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps (JROTC) program provides improved academic rigor and postsecondary preparedness for program students. Students are engaged in a curriculum that emphasizes leadership, wellness, fitness and civics to prepare them for postsecondary success including a pathway for military enlistment, as well as developing lifelong leadership and decision making skills.</li>

<p>Through the generosity of Lilly Endowment Inc., IPS received a $2.87 million Lilly Counseling Initiative Grant to implement Future Centers at four IPS high schools and expand Social Emotional Learning (SEL) curriculum in Grades K-8.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Launched in Fall 2018, the Future Centers are physical spaces and serve as school-based advising centers where students can define their college and career plans, and receive guidance and support to execute them. Future Center staff partner with their school’s traditional academic counselors and are equipped with educators focused solely on assisting students with developing and executing post-secondary plans.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The delineation between in-school support provided by counselors and postsecondary planning support provided by college and career readiness is intentional and reflects IPS’ investment in postsecondary readiness.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The centers create a hub for students and families to meet with community-based organizations, higher education partners, military recruiters and employers. Future Center staff has identified mission-aligned partners to drive year-round programming opportunities for students to advance post-secondary plans.&nbsp; Future Center staff, in conjunction with the district’s Postsecondary Readiness team, are also developing and implementing persistence programming to support IPS students after graduation. Persistence programming aligns with the district's 3E strategy for IPS high schools, with differentiated opportunities for students who are enrolled, enlisted or employed upon graduation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The High School Future Centers are designed to help our students take the steps needed to successfully transition to Enrollment, Enlistment or Employment upon graduation. Students can avail themselves to valuable support services in the areas of college and career-readiness skill building, mentoring, technical assistance and more.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Featuring the latest technology, strong support from our collegiate and corporate partners, and knowledgeable and friendly staff, our Future Center and its resources are available to our scholars throughout their high school experience and during their journey through college or early years in the workforce.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Services include:</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Mentoring</strong> – Individualized or group mentoring sessions offer students support during their high school years to help them overcome any social and emotional hurdles they encounter.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Interview Training</strong> – Mock interviews, through one-on-one or group training, help students prepare for upcoming job or college/military interviews by perfecting skills and providing valuable feedback.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>College Application Support</strong> – Staff provides students with assistance in understanding and completing financial-aid forms and scholarship applications, and researching additional ways to make college affordable and attainable.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Tutoring</strong> – Whether students are preparing for college essays, the ACT or SAT, or just need additional support, tutoring in math and writing are provided to foster greater understanding and mastery of core curriculum.</li>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Indianapolis Public Schools Foundation (IPSF) has been supporting the Indianapolis Public Schools (IPS) district since May 1984.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>IPSF strives to be a strong partner, collaborator and champion by increasing resources that specifically support teachers, schools and administrators in the district.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While IPS has sought to direct more resources to schools and classrooms, the district has seen funding from federal, state and local sources decrease. IPSF partners with IPS to provide philanthropic capital to close these gaps and to fulfill the district’s mission.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As a mission-driven development organization, IPSF brings fundraising expertise and capacity, thus allowing IPS administrators to focus on their core business — leadership in support of excellent teaching and learning.</p>

<h2>How Does IPSF Support IPS?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>IPSF utilizes three primary pathways of partnership with the district. This includes:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Micro Grant Program:</strong> IPS teachers, school leaders and central services staff apply to IPSF for micro grants to support various projects including special programs, supplies, uniforms, field trips and other unique opportunities. IPSF’s Grants Committee reviews these applications on a rolling basis.</li><li><strong>Districtwide events and programs: </strong>IPSF secures sponsorships and in-kind contributions supporting events to recognize and celebrate district students, teachers and school leaders.<ul><li>Interested in sponsoring an event with IPS? Contact Kelly Karbowicz Riley, IPSF director of development, at <a href="mailto:kriley@ipsef.org">kriley@ipsef.org</a>.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Districtwide grants: </strong>IPSF partners with IPS leadership, the subject matter experts, to develop proposals for major gifts, administer awarded grant funding and steward partnerships with granting organizations to support district priorities.</li></ul>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner">The Indianapolis Public Schools Education Foundation (IPSEF) has been supporting the Indianapolis Public Schools (IPS) district since May 1984.<br />
IPSEF strives to be a strong partner, collaborator and champion by increasing resources that specifically support teachers, schools and administrators in the district.<br />
While IPS has sought to direct more resources to schools and classrooms, the district has seen funding from federal, state and local sources decrease. IPSEF partners with IPS to provide philanthropic capital to close these gaps and to fulfill the district’s mission.<br />
As a mission-driven development organization, IPSEF brings fundraising expertise and capacity, thus allowing IPS administrators to focus on their core business — leadership in support of excellent teaching and learning.<br />
How Does IPSEF Support IPS?<br />
IPSEF utilizes three primary pathways of partnership with the district. This includes:</p>
<p>Micro Grant Program: IPS teachers, school leaders and central services staff apply to IPSEF for micro grants to support various projects including special programs, supplies, uniforms, field trips, and other unique opportunities. IPSEF’s Grants Committee reviews these applications on a rolling basis.<br />
Districtwide events and programs: IPSEF secures sponsorships and in-kind contributions supporting events to recognize and celebrate district students, teachers and school leaders.</p>
<p>Interested in sponsoring an event with IPS? Contact Kelly Karbowicz Riley, IPSEF director of development, at kriley@ipsef.org.</p>
<p>Districtwide grants: IPSEF partners with IPS leadership, the subject matter experts, to develop proposals for major gifts, administer awarded grant funding, and steward partnerships with granting organizations to support district priorities.</div>

					Beginning August 5, students from Arsenal Tech, Crispus Attucks, George Washington and Shortridge can opt to ride IndyGo, the city’s public transit system, to and from school instead of using the district’s yellow school buses. (The program started in 2018 with students from Arsenal Tech and Shortridge.)<br />
Students will still receive a traditional yellow bus assignment for the school year and be allowed to ride their yellow bus to and from school whenever they choose. The use of IndyGo is offered as an additional option.<br />
The goal of the program is twofold:</p>
<p>To provide IPS high school students with a new benefit that offers greater mobility to navigate throughout the city while gaining new skills and independence as they move toward their post-secondary plans.<br />
In future years, to help IPS reduce its transportation budget significantly in order to increase resources to the classroom. This plan was communicated in the run up to the 2018 November election in which voters approved new funds for the district.

Seats in the front of the bus are reserved for people with disabilities, mobility aids, expectant mothers and the elderly.<br />
Riders are discouraged from occupying more than one seat.<br />
Personal belongings should fit in a rider’s lap or under their seat.</p>
<p>Conduct and Noise<br />

We look at the locally forecasted wind chills for our district and if they’re predicted to fall near the danger zone by 7 a.m., we would consider a two-hour delay.<br />
If wind chills aren’t expected to improve by 9 a.m. (when a two-hour delay would end), we would consider a cancellation.</div>

<p>Students in Indianapolis Public Schools must complete the state mandated graduation requirements in order to be awarded a high school diploma.

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dr. Aleesia Johnson serves as superintendent of Indianapolis Public Schools (IPS), the largest district in Indiana serving more than 30,000 students. Named superintendent in 2019, Dr. Johnson has entered her second decade of service as an educator, achieving success as a teacher, school leader and administrator in both public charter and traditional district schools.&nbsp;She is the first Black woman to serve as superintendent in Indianapolis Public Schools.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A native of Evansville, Indiana, Johnson comes from a family of educators, including her mother, who is an elementary school principal, her grandfather, who was one of few African American administrators in the Evansville area during the 1970s and 80s, and her grandmother, who worked as a high school classroom assistant.&nbsp;Growing up in her mother’s middle school classroom, Dr. Johnson began her career as a 6th grade Science and Social Studies teacher.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dr. Johnson holds a Bachelor of Arts degree in Psychology and African American Studies from Agnes Scott College, a Master of Social Work in Children and Youth and Community Organizing from the University of Michigan, a Master of Arts in Teaching degree in Secondary Education and a Doctor of Education in Educational Leadership, both from Oakland City University. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dr. Johnson believes deeply in service not only to the students and families of IPS but also to the broader Indianapolis community. She demonstrates this belief through her membership on several local organizational boards, including The Arts Council of Indianapolis, the Indianapolis 500 Festival, the IUPUI Board of Advisors, and the Board of Trustees for Ivy Tech Community College, Indianapolis Campus. She serves on the advisory board at Harvard University’s Center for Education Policy Research and is also a member of the Aspen Superintendents Network as well as Chiefs For Change, a national advocacy organization of state and district education leaders. Dr. Johnson is privileged to also be an active member of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Incorporated.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dr. Johnson and her husband, Andre, are the proud parents of an adult daughter, Deja, and three school-aged children, Frederick, Naomi and Grace, who are also IPS students. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>If You Are a Student Who Has Experienced Sexual Misconduct, Dating Violence, Stalking or Harassment</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Call 9-1-1 or the IPS Department
(317-226-4644)&nbsp;<em>If you are in danger or need immediate medical care.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Sexual Misconduct</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you have experienced sexual misconduct, dating violence, stalking or harassment, it is important to talk to an adult that you trust. This could be a family member, teacher, social worker or anyone else you feel comfortable with. If this behavior is affecting your education or an educational activity please report it to IPS so we can help.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Sexual Assault</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By going to the hospital you can receive a&nbsp;<a href="https://rainn.org/get-information/sexual-assault-recovery/rape-kit">Forensic Medical Exam</a>&nbsp;(often referred to as a “rape kit”) which will help in the collection and preservation of physical evidence as a result of the assault. Many hospitals throughout the state have nurses who are specially trained to provide care and administer the Forensic Medical Exam. You can call a hospital to see if it has a&nbsp;<a href="https://indianacesa.org/resources/sanes-victim-advocates/">Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner</a>&nbsp;(SANE) available. Indiana has a number of hospitals with specialized programs within them called&nbsp;<a href="http://www.eskenazihealth.edu/our-services/emergency-department/center-of-hope">The Center of Hope</a>. The Center of Hope is dedicated to caring for victims of sexual assault and family violence.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Harassment &amp; Stalking</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Teen dating harassment or stalking can take place in person or electronically, such as repeated texting or posting sexual pictures of a partner online without consent. Unhealthy relationships can start early and last a lifetime. Teens often think some behaviors, like teasing and name calling, are a “normal” part of a relationship, but these behaviors can become abusive and develop into serious forms of violence. Many teens do not report these behaviors because they are afraid to tell family and friends. It is important to tell someone you trust so that you can get help.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Support</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is also important to get continued help if you have experienced sexual misconduct or dating violence. IPS can connect you with a youth advocate and/or counselor to guide you and provide information and emotional support. Counseling can help begin the healing process. Your school can help put measures in place to protect you such as class schedule changes, locker reassignments, no contact orders, bus assignment changes and more.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>If You Are a Student Who Has Been Accused of Sexual Misconduct, Dating Violence, Stalking or Harassment</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Support</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you or someone you know is accused of sexual misconduct, dating violence, or stalking, IPS has resources available for you. It is normal to feel worried, confused, or overwhelmed. It is important to seek out support to help you, especially in cases of a formal investigation by IPS, the Department of Child Protective Services, and/or the police. Please contact an adult you trust at school such as a social worker, counselor, or principal. They can help you through the process.</p>

<p>The goal at IPS is to make reporting sexual misconduct, dating violence, stalking or retaliation as easy and comfortable as possible.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We have several options for students and/or guardians:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>You can report directly to the Title IX Coordinator, Kim Kennedy, at 317-226-4644 or <a href="mailto:titleixcoordinator@myips.org">titleixcoordinator@myips.org</a>. </li><li>You can call IPS Police Department at 317-226-4633. </li><li>You can tell a Principal, Social Worker, Counselor, Teen Dating Advocate or any other school employee, either verbally or in writing. All employees at IPS are “mandatory reporters,” which means that all employees are required to report these instances to the Title IX Coordinator, and in some cases, the Department of Child Protective Services. </li></ul>

<p>If your friend has experienced sexual misconduct, dating violence or stalking, she/he may not be able to or ready to officially report it, but you can still help. Here are some helpful tips to keep in mind when talking to a friend about their experience:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>DON'T decide what’s best for them. When someone is abused or violated, they often feel victimized and need time to decide what to do.</li><li>DON’T judge them or doubt their story. If a friend is confiding in you about being assaulted or harmed, it is important to not victim blame. For example, don’t say things like, “I told you to break up with him. Why didn’t you listen?”</li><li>DON'T minimize what happened. Sometimes in an effort to make someone feel better, it’s easy to try and say that they will feel better soon or that it’s “no big deal.” These statements may make them feel bad about certain feelings they are having.</li><li>DO let them know they are believed and supported. It is very common for victims of abuse to think that nobody will believe them. If they are confiding in you, they trust that you will be supportive.</li><li>DO ask what they need. People cope and respond differently to being abused. Some like to talk about their feelings. Others like to be alone. Don’t assume you know what they may want or need.</li><li>DO encourage them to seek help. It can be scary to tell an adult or the police about what happened. Remind them that there are people at school who can help. Also, it is very important to encourage them to seek medical help after an assault.</li><li>DO continue to be supportive. After the initial shock of what happened, it can be easy to assume they are ok. Be sure to check in on them even if they seem to be “back to normal.”</li><li>DO take care of yourself. It can be difficult and overwhelming to be present for a friend in need. Remember to take care of yourself and seek out help if needed.</li></ul>

<p>"Many white parents have never learned how to talk about race and racism with their kids. Their silence perpetuates racism—but it can be hard to know how to start. This hour-long program is about talking to white kids about race and racism: how white parents, families, and teachers can learn to show up for racial justice in a way that will make a difference for generations to come. The show explores a wide variety of approaches with kids of all ages."</p>

<p>A gem about colorblindness and parental influence from White parents: “ In a study of 100 White families with White kids whose White parents taught color-blindedness. When asked do your parents like Black people 38% said, ‘I don't know.’ 14% said, ‘Nope.’”</p>

<p>The Indiana Department of Health advises that we assume anyone with COVID symptoms has COVID-19 until proven otherwise.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Students and staff with symptoms should follow one of the following:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Take a test and if positive, follow the 5-day isolation protocols.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If the test is negative return only when symptoms have significantly improved.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If not testing, encouraged to wait out the five days of isolation and/or return when symptoms significantly improve and be fever free for 24 hours.<br>Testing when showing any symptoms is strongly recommended to ensure we are not spreading COVID-19 within our schools. If you need help accessing testing, contact your school clinic for additional information.</p>

<p>Indianapolis Public Schools has invested in crossing guards for the 2020–21 school year to help to ensure that our students who walk or bike to school can do so in a safe and secure way. The addition of crossing guards also allows the district to fully implement its longstanding walk-zone policy, and to ensure proper social distancing on district school buses. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As IPS returns to in-person learning, the district is enforcing walk zones for 13 of our schools.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Families affected by this change have been informed that their student(s) are ineligible for transportation services and have been assigned the "walker" designation for their transportation status. Notices sent to families were based on their current address and is compliant with the current IPS walk-zone policy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In conjunction with our walk zones, we are strengthening our current Indy-Go partnership and implementing a hybrid learning model for our middle and high school students.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The map below shows the locations for additional crossing guards at our schools.</p>

<p>At IPS, we believe all students can achieve their full potential, learn at high levels and graduate prepared to succeed in schools, career and life. We are committed to ensuring that every student in every neighborhood receives the education and opportunities they deserve. Much work still needs to be done.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is more evident than ever-- in the midst of a global pandemic and the largest civil rights movement of a generation-- what is at stake and the important new role we play. Under the leadership of Superintendent Dr. Aleesia Johnson, we will continue to make racial equity a top priority. And our actions will support our convictions. Strategic Plan 2025, outlined here, is based on our core values and was developed with feedback from thousands of students, educators, families and community members.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Q&amp;As listed below are from the IndyGo feedback forms and transportation town halls. The list will be updated regularly.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>What is IndyGo?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>IndyGo is the city’s public transit bus system. It is the largest public transit system in the state of Indiana.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Why is IPS proposing to remove yellow bus service from select high school students?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>IPS has significantly higher transportation costs per pupil compared to peer districts. Because of these costs, coupled with several factors related to COVID-19 and a $15 million district shortfall for the current school year, IPS has developed a strategic approach to maximize funding that doesn’t negatively affect classrooms.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>When will this transition take place?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>If approved by the IPS Board of School Commissioners, selected high school students will begin to use IndyGo as their transportation to and from school beginning with the 2021–22 school year.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>What will transitioning high school students from yellow bus to IndyGo mean for students?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Students who are selected for this transition, as well as those who opt-in to the program, will receive a free IndyGo bus pass from the district.</li><li>The IndyGo bus pass will be embedded into the student’s school-issued ID.</li><li>Students will use IndyGo to get to and from school.&nbsp;</li><li>IPS yellow bus service will <strong>NO LONGER</strong> be available to these students.</li><li>Students can also use their school-issued ID to travel throughout the city.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>How will students be selected for the IndyGo transition?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Students who will have zero IndyGo bus transfers, have less than a .7 mile total walk, and have less than a 50-minute total journey time (walk + wait + ride) will be the first group of students transitioned to IndyGo.</li><li>For a majority of impacted students, they will experience a shorter travel time on IndyGo than they would on an IPS yellow bus.</li><li>Based on initial estimates, 605 students will be affected during the 2021–22 school year.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Can students/families opt-in to the IndyGo program?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Additional high school students may opt-out of IPS transportation and opt-in to IndyGo bus service for the school year.</li><li>Students that opt-in to IndyGo service will <strong>NO LONGER</strong> be able to utilize the IPS yellow bus service.</li><li>Students will be able to opt-in via an online form located on the IPS website&nbsp; if the board votes in April to move forward with this transition.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<p><strong>What happens to the free IndyGo passes for high school students who aren't selected or opt-in to the program?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Students who aren’t selected for or opt-in to the IndyGo program for the 2021–22 school year won’t receive a free annual IndyGo bus pass (which they had received in years prior).</li><li>Because of the district’s budget shortfall and desire to not negatively impact classrooms, IPS cannot afford to continue providing two methods of bus service for all high school students — the free annual bus passes and yellow bus service.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>How many students will be affected by the transition?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>During the 2021–22 school year, approximately 605 high school students will use IndyGo as their primary means of transportation to and from school.</li><li>This includes students from Grades 9-12; incoming freshmen for the 2021–22 school year are included in the calculation.&nbsp;</li><li>IPS expects this to be the first transition of students with additional high school students being transitioned to IndyGo over the next 1-2 years.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Which schools will this transition affect?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Select students will come from Arsenal Tech, Crispus Attucks, Emmerich Manual, George Washington, Graduation Academy, KIPP Indy Legacy, Newcomer Program @ Northwest Middle School, Shortridge and Thrival Academy will be selected to transition to IndyGo as their primary service for transport to and from school.</li><li>This new proposal is simply the next planned phase of the pilot program, which has been successful since its original rollout.</li><li>Students at Herron, Riverside and Purdue Polytechnic already use IndyGo as an option for transportation to and from school and were not previously transported using yellow bus service.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>How will this affect field trips and extra-curricular activities, including sports?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Transitioning select students to IndyGo won’t have an effect on field trips, extra-curricular activities or athletics.</li><li><strong>Field Trips:</strong> IPS provides sufficient coverage for up to seven (7) field trips per student per year.</li><li><strong>Athletics: </strong>IPS provides transportation for students to participate in athletic events to and from their school.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>What are the benefits of students riding IndyGo?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>87% of students selected by the district to ride IndyGo will have a shorter ride time to and from school — with an average total journey time of 25 minutes and no more than 50 minutes — and no bus transfers. Student ride times for these same students on yellow bus range from 60 to 75 minutes.</li><li>Students will gain more independence and skills that will prepare them for graduation and beyond as they master navigating the city’s transit system.</li><li>Students will gain more freedom to ride the bus to and from school, work, extracurricular activities, or simply to explore the city.</li><li>Connectivity to the city at-large can also allow students to feel more connected with the community and their surroundings.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Where can I get more detail on this proposed transition?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><a href="https://www.indygo.net/student-program/">&nbsp;IndyGo Student Pass Partnership Program</a></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Does IPS administration need Board approval to move forward with the high school transportation plan?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Yes, Board approval is needed.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>When will IPS make a final decision on whether to move high school students from yellow bus to IndyGo?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>District administration will present its transportation proposal to the IPS Board of School Commissioners during the Board Action Session on March 25, 2021.</li><li>Board Commissioners will vote during the April Action Session on April 29, 2021.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Will community members be able to weigh in?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>The IPS Board of School Commissioners will review/discuss recommendations during the March 25 Board Action Session.&nbsp;</li><li>Action won’t take place until the April 29 Board Action Session.&nbsp;</li><li>Families, schools and the community will be given opportunities to provide feedback through a variety of engagement options while the Board considers the recommendations.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>How will the district communicate these changes to affected families?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Families affected by this change will be informed directly by the district that their student(s) has been assigned to IndyGo as their primary means of transportation to and from school.&nbsp;</li><li>Notices will be sent to families based on their current address.<ul><li>Affected families will also be invited to attend Transportation Town Halls, which are currently being planned by the district.</li><li>Full details about this transition will be added to the district’s website soon.</li></ul></li><li>The district will also provide sponsored ride opportunities for impacted students and their families to experience IndyGo together firsthand.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>What if I have an issue with the bus stop(s)?</strong>&nbsp;<br>IPS is working closely with IndyGo to identify and designate appropriate bus stops. Students will not be “assigned” bus stops and may be able to use multiple stops during their morning and afternoon transit.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Will we still communicate the stop closest to students even if it’s not “assigned?”&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Students should communicate any issues related to an IndyGo stop or bus to their school’s Family and Community Engagement (FACE) liaison, school leadership or IndyGo partnership liaison.<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>How is the district keeping students safe if the bus stops aren’t in safe areas?</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Most IndyGo bus stops are in the same areas as current yellow bus stops.</li><li>We ask families to use the same safety protocols they use now when traveling to and from yellow bus stops.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>How will students be protected while riding an IndyGo bus?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are a variety of ways IndyGo works to keep riders safe, including:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Audio and video surveillance equipment at the Transit Center and on all buses and platforms.</li><li>Emergency call boxes.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Uniformed and undercover police officers who ride IndyGo buses, monitor bus stops and the IndyGo Transit Center.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Is there any exemption or process to appeal being &nbsp;transitioned onto&nbsp;IndyGo?</strong><br>For students who meet the criteria approved by the IPS Board, an IndyGo transit pass will be issued in lieu of a yellow bus assignment. Students may not opt-out of IndyGo if they meet the approved criteria.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>If something happens with a student on IndyGo, who is the contact with whom parents can connect?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>Students/parents should contact their FACE Liaison, the school leadership team or the IPS transportation team at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:IPSTransportation@myips.org">IPSTransportation@myips.org</a>&nbsp;with questions or concerns related to IndyGo.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Will IPS Police and/or IMPD have a presence at the walk zones and IndyGo bus stops?&nbsp;<br></strong>IPS PD will provide support at high-volume bus stops located nearest our four large high schools in the mornings during student arrival and in the afternoons during student dismissal.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>If my child has an IEP or 504, are they required to walk or be moved to IndyGo?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Students that have transportation services included in their IEP or 504 plan will continue to receive yellow bus services as required. Students with special needs and those receiving McKinney-Vento services will continue to receive transportation services per their Individualized Education Plan or their McKinney-Vento status, respectively.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>What happens if there are changes with IndyGo? Routes closed, etc.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>IPS and IndyGo will work closely to monitor any changes to the IndyGo transit network to ensure that students continue to receive reliable transportation aligned to the criteria approved by the board.&nbsp;<strong></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Why is IPS removing the IndyGo pass from students who will use yellow bus service? Some students have relied on the pass over the past two to three years (Aleesia)<br></strong>Because of the district’s budget shortfall and desire to not negatively impact classrooms, IPS cannot afford to continue providing two methods of bus service — the free annual IndyGo bus pass and yellow bus service — for all high school students. Students can keep their IndyGo bus pass if they opt out of yellow bus service.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>How is the district accommodating for ESL students for both the walk zones and IndyGo?&nbsp;<br></strong>All district communication and information regarding walk zones and IndyGo will be translated to support Spanish-speaking ESL students.<strong></strong></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Q&amp;As listed below are from the Walk Zone feedback forms and transportation town halls. The list will be updated regularly.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Why is IPS executing the Walk Zones policy for students in Grades K–12?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>IPS has had a walk zone policy since 1998.</li><li>The district began executing the walk zone policy during the 2020–21 school year to help keep students safe while social distancing on IPS yellow buses due to COVID-19.</li><li>For the 2020–21 school year, the policy was enforced at 13 schools throughout the district, affecting 3,000+ students.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Does IPS administration need Board approval to execute the Walk Zone policy at more schools and with more students for the 2021–22 school year?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>No, Board approval is not required to fully execute the walk zone policy because it is an existing policy.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>How does executing the Walk Zone policy benefit the district?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Decreasing the number of K–12 students on IPS yellow buses will significantly help IPS reduce its transportation budget, which will help decrease the district’s $15 million deficit, and place more money in classrooms.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Will this affect any other schools in the future?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Yes. For the 2021–22 school year, an additional 2,000+ students will be impacted by the execution of prescribed walk boundaries.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Who are considered Walk Zone students?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Children are classified as a walker if the following conditions are met:<ul><li>K–6 students who reside 1 mile or less from their school.</li><li>7–8 students who reside 1.25 miles or less from their school.</li><li>9–12 students who reside 1.5 miles or less from their school.</li><li>Students who qualify as McKinney-Vento or special education are exempt.</li></ul></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>How will I know if my child will be affected by this change?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Families affected by this change have been informed that their student(s) are ineligible for transportation services and have been assigned the “walker” designation for their transportation status. </li><li>Letters were sent in late March to families based on their current address, and are compliant with the current IPS walk zone policy. </li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>What schools and how many students were impacted by Walk Zone policy during the 2020–21 school year?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>There were 3,000+ students impacted by the Walk Zone policy at 13 IPS schools. Those schools were:<ul><li>Carl Wilde School 79</li><li>Center for Inquiry School 27</li><li>Center for Inquiry School 84</li><li>Christian Park School 82</li><li>Ignite Achievement Academy @ Elder Diggs 42</li><li>James Whitcomb Riley School 43</li><li>Kindezi Academy @ Joyce Kilmer 69</li><li>Lew Wallace School 107</li><li>Matchbook Learning @ Wendell Phillips School 63</li><li>Northwest Middle School</li><li>Ralph Waldo Emerson School 58</li><li>Thomas Gregg Neighborhood School</li><li>William Penn School 49</li></ul></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>How many schools will be impacted by the Walk Zone policy during the 2021–22 school year:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>All IPS schools will be impacted by the 2021-22 Walk Zone policy.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>How many students will be impacted by Walk Zone policy during the 2021–22 school year?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>An additional 2,000+ students will be designated as “walkers” for the 2021–22 school year.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>What is the district doing to keep student walkers safe?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>IPS invested in crossing guards at certain schools for the 2020–21 school year to help to ensure students who walk or bike to school can do so in a safe and secure way.&nbsp;</li><li>Additional crossing guards will be added for the 2021–22 school year, where needed.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Can families opt out of the Walk Zone and request IPS transportation?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Transportation may be provided for students who live within the walking distance guidelines when physical barriers prevent safe travel (i.e. busy intersections) to school or when required because of a qualifying medical condition of the student.</li><li>To request a walk zone exemption for your student, please complete <a href="https://myips.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Walk-Zone-Exemption-Request-Form-2020-21.pdf">Walk Zone Exemption Request Form</a>.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>What if I have an issue with the safety of the walk zone route area?</strong> <br>Students and families may communicate safety concerns in their walk zone to their Family and Community Engagement (FACE) Liaison, school leadership, or to the IPS transportation team at <a href="mailto:IPSTransportation@myips.org">IPSTransportation@myips.org</a>. There is also a walk zone Exemption Request Form that can be submitted to request consideration of a safety bus assignment under limited circumstances.<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Will every school, per the walk zone policy, have crossing guards?<br></strong>Crossing guards will be strategically placed at any school campus where it’s deemed necessary for the safe passage of students. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>What if I live in a neighborhood that doesn’t have sidewalks?<br></strong>Pedestrian infrastructure will be factored when determining whether a student has a safe route to school. However, the absence of sidewalks will not automatically result in safety bussing if it is determined that a safe walking route to school still exists.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Is the district working with the City of Indianapolis and the Department of Public Works (DPW) on the sidewalks, snow removal, streetlights, etc.?&nbsp;<br></strong>Yes, IPS is working with the City/DPW to identify issues related to the streetscape and supporting infrastructure within walk zones.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>If my child has an IEP or 504, are they required to walk or be moved to IndyGo?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Students that have transportation services included in their IEP or 504 plan will continue to receive yellow bus services as required. Students with special needs and those receiving McKinney-Vento services will continue to receive transportation services per their Individualized Education Plan or their McKinney-Vento status, respectively.</p>

		<title><![CDATA[Student Based Allocation]]></title>
		<link>https://myips.org/central-services/finance/student-based-allocation/</link>
		<pubDate>Thu, 24 Jun 2021 14:17:38 +0000</pubDate>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Student Based Allocation (SBA)</strong>&nbsp;is a funding formula that distributes resources to schools according to student needs and characteristics. School leaders then decide how to use those resources to best support their students. As of the 2017-18 school year, IPS uses SBA to develop budgets for all schools.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Goals of SBA:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Equity:&nbsp;</strong>Equitably fund each student at each school based on his or her educational needs.</li><li><strong>Flexibility:&nbsp;</strong>Provide principals more flexibility to make budgetary and academic decisions that meet the needs of their individual school.</li><li><strong>Transparency:&nbsp;</strong>Clearly show exactly how much funding each school receives and why.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>SBA is about spending limited dollars wisely</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The shift to SBA allows IPS to more efficiently direct resources to where students need them most; but it does not replace the need to make tough decisions about the way money is spent. SBA allows IPS to focus on investing in programs that work, protect the progress made, and put the interests of students first in every decision.</p>

<p>The global pandemic has taken its toll on many aspects of education&nbsp;—&nbsp;from the need for personal protective equipment (PPE) and technology to academic programming to address learning loss.&nbsp;It’s&nbsp;a daunting situation school districts across the country have faced over the last year. But federal funds distributed throughout the 2020–21 school year have been issued to offset those expenses and losses from the pandemic through COVID-19 federal stimulus relief funds.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So far, three rounds of federal funding in the form of the Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief (ESSER) funding have been approved by Congress. For Indianapolis Public Schools (IPS), that funding totals $213.5 million.</p>

<p>“COVID-19 has had a profound impact on our students, staff and community,” said Andrew Strope, IPS chief of strategy and planning. “The federal stimulus funds have already played a vital role in our ability to operate during a very challenging school year. We were able to utilize support from the first round of stimulus funds received in March of 2020 to promote student and staff safety, invest in technology, and execute a remote learning model. These funds helped IPS navigate the 2020–2021 school year.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Round 1&nbsp;</strong>(passed in March 2020), totaled $17 million.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Round 2&nbsp;</strong>(passed in December 2020), totaled $60.5 million.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Round 3&nbsp;</strong>(passed March 2021), is projected to total $136 million.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s a large sum of money flowing into IPS at a time when it’s needed most, but there are restrictions on&nbsp;how this funding can be used. The funds must be used by 2024 and therefore cannot address long-term initiatives to guarantee financial sustainability or&nbsp;address the district’s structural deficit.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"With a time bound federal stimulus and state funding increase, the district’s long-term financial sustainability will still require difficult decisions and tradeoffs,” said Strope. “IPS currently spends 1.5 to 2 times the amount per pupil in transportation costs than similarly situated urban school districts. The federal stimulus funds, while incredibly helpful, are a one-time influx of dollars and therefore should not be used to offset recurring expenses like transportation costs.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>IPS has developed a framework aligned to the district’s Strategic Plan 2025&nbsp;that focuses on three priority areas.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The first priority focuses on an investment in student learning. In the short term, that means learning acceleration through programs like summer school and tutoring programs. In the long-term, the funding will create supports to strengthen Tier 1 or general instruction. This will provide access to grade level curriculum and to the rigorous instruction and professional development necessary for teachers to effectively implement the curriculum.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The second priority will evolve IT infrastructure for 21st-century learning. This includes moving the IPS network to a modernized infrastructure, including transitioning it to the cloud or a data center offsite to&nbsp;protect the district’s network from physical risk.&nbsp;It will also invest in staff technology needs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The third priority focuses on the potential investment facilities and operational costs. This means additional PPE and modernized central controls over building systems, including upgrading mechanical&nbsp;systems at buildings not currently integrated on the district’s heating and cooling central control system.&nbsp;It will also allow for more efficient energy management.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It is important that we focus on high-leverage investments and do not overwhelm schools with numerous disjointed projects and initiatives,” said Strope.&nbsp;“Aligning to these priorities allows us to target our efforts and investments in a way that will enhance the positive impact for our students and families both in the short and long term. The framework also allows for flexibility and responsiveness. We will continue to assess the needs of our students and staff as we begin the 2021–22 school year.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As the district navigates this framework, it has already started engagement opportunities with the community to gather feedback and guide the specifics in spending. The district’s online&nbsp;ESSER tracking tool transparently tracks expenditures so the public can follow along as IPS works to aggressively combat the negative effects of COVID-19.</p>

<p>In June 2021, the IPS Board of School Commissioners formally adopted the Board Goals found below. The goals are specifically aligned to the district’s Strategic Plan 2025 and reflect the priorities and values of the Board. Many of the goals, while aspirational in nature, demonstrate the Board’s commitment to eliminating the achievement gap between students of color and their white peers, ensuring that every student within IPS boundaries has a high-quality school to call home in which they feel valued and welcomed. The Board will receive updates on a continual basis throughout the year on progress toward goal completion.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By 2025, the IPS Board of School Commissioners will work to meet the following goals: </p>

<h2>What is the Rebuilding Stronger Initiative?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rebuilding Stronger is designed to reinvent, rebuild, redesign and rethink IPS’ family of schools, how it spends resources, and how to effectively leverage facilities — with a heavy focus on stakeholder engagement. The ultimate commitment is ensuring excellent schools for all students in all neighborhoods throughout the IPS district.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This four phase, year-long initiative began in September 2021 with IPS Superintendent Dr. Aleesia Johnson’s State of the District speech, followed by Phase 1 of Rebuilding Stronger which included a series of Community Conversations that resulted in the following tangibles:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Guiding Principles:</strong> A list of 10 attributes to ensure vision attainment.</li><li><strong>Commitments to Our Community:</strong> A set of commitments aligned to IPS values that will guide future engagement, planning and implementation.</li><li><strong>Stakeholder Input Report:</strong> A collection of the feedback received from stakeholders, including key themes and insights, details of the desired vision from stakeholders.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>4 <strong>Phases of Engagement</strong></h2>

<h2>Background: Vision and Priorities</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>During the 2021 State of the District, Dr. Aleesia Johnson kicked off a year-long community engagement process to Rebuild Stronger. As she said then, our vision for IPS is clear — a sustainable district that serves all our students with excellence, warmth, support and love, and that never again sorts children’s possibilities. She also made clear: we need to develop the solutions to get there together.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Advisory Committee: First Meeting</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On February 28, the Rebuilding Stronger community process continued with the first meeting of a new advisory committee, made up of parents and students, teachers and school leaders, Board members and other elected officials, community organizations and nonprofits, and the business community. The committee is reviewing internal data and third-party assessments on facilities, school performance, academic programming, enrollment, and more to assist the district in developing draft plans. Read more from the meeting below — or <a href="https://vimeo.com/683486885?embedded=true&amp;source=video_title&amp;owner=100204818">watch a recording of the full meeting HERE.</a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Why Now</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We are in a moment in which it has become more evident than ever the important role our schools play in our communities. We must not miss the opportunity to strengthen them – to give ALL students a shot at excellence. We know we need structural changes, and we believe the time for that is now while we have the time to discuss decisions as a community.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Strengths to Build From</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We are starting from a place of many strengths and assets:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>We have a rich history in our city and serve a diverse community of students and families.</li><li>We offer many high-quality choices across the district.</li><li>We’ve invested in the pay of our teachers and leaders and our staff retention rates are rising.</li><li>We have incredible partners and supporters across the city.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Defining the Challenge</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We know our strengths, but we also know we’ve got work to do. At the meeting, the committee began diving into the data, centered around 4 key areas:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol><li>&nbsp;<strong>Student experience:</strong>&nbsp;We know too many of our students are not experiencing strong academic performance and their school experience varies depending on the school they attend. Proficiency gaps are growing for Black, Latino, low-income and English-Language Learner students, and vary by what type of school a student attends. How do we improve student mobility and build a district that is excellent AND equitable?</li><li><strong>Facilities:</strong>&nbsp;25% of our buildings are in poor or worse condition, and it would cost over $460 million to bring every building to “good” or better. How should we best use our facilities so every child is in a building that is safe, warm, and welcoming?</li><li><strong>Enrollment and Choice:</strong>&nbsp;Overall enrollment is increasing throughout our family of IPS schools, but we need to work to drive that same growth across all IPS schools. How do we ensure every child has access to excellent schools and a variety of programs?</li><li><strong>Financial Sustainability:</strong>&nbsp;We’re taking key steps to invest in students and teachers, while also stabilizing our budget. But we need to make more decisions to ensure we don’t go into the red. How do we make our budget sustainable for the long-term?</li></ol>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Phase<mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-luminous-vivid-orange-color"> </mark>1</strong>, which focused on vision and setting priorities, ended in late October. Since then, the IPS Board of School Commissioners — along with the IPS administration — engaged with the feedback received and created the following tangibles:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Guiding Principles</strong>&nbsp;— A list of 10 attributes to ensure vision attainment.</li><li><strong>Commitments to Our Community</strong>&nbsp;— A set of commitments aligned to IPS values that will guide future engagement, planning and implementation.</li><li><strong>Stakeholder Input Report</strong>&nbsp;— A collection of the feedback received from stakeholders, including key themes and insights that detail the desired vision from stakeholders.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The four-phase approach includes planning and modeling as well refining and finalizing of a strategy born from the input and feedback from all IPS stakeholders.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rebuilding Stronger initiative is designed to reinvent, rebuild, redesign and rethink IPS’ family if schools, how it spends resources, and how to effectively leverage facilities — with the ultimate commitment of ensuring excellent schools for all students in all neighborhoods throughout the IPS district.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Data Overview: What we Learned</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>We’ve got work to do to provide equitable, welcoming learning environments in every neighborhood: Only 31% of our buildings are in “good” condition; 21% of our buildings are in poor or worse condition.</li><li>We’ve got more work ahead: The average age of the district’s buildings is 61 years, which is similar to that of other urban school districts nationwide.</li><li>It would cost an enormous amount to do all the work we need to do: It would cost an estimated $466 million to bring all district buildings to a condition of “good” or better.&nbsp;<ul><li>For context, this is equivalent to:<ul><li>the district’s annual operating budget of ~$500 million</li><li>the entire annual Capital Projects budget for 9 years</li><li>not having yellow bus transportation services for students for 12 years</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul>

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><strong>Opportunities to Build From&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>IPS has made significant investments in our technology infrastructure, which shows up in the data: 90% of our facilities are “good,” “new,” or “like new” when it comes to technology readiness.</li><li>We have good momentum to build from on the academic readiness of our facilities: 57% of our schools are rated “good” or better on this metric.&nbsp;<ul><li>This means they have the learning environment, space size, location and the appropriate storage and equipment for an ideal learning environment.</li></ul></li></ul>

<p><strong><em>Guiding Principles</em></strong><em> — As IPS and its stakeholders work toward improving districtwide enrollment, we will do so grounded in the following Guiding Principles.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><em>How can we grow and replicate schools and programs with </em><strong><em>demonstrated academic success in supporting all students and closing the opportunity gap</em></strong><em>?</em></li><li><em>How do we create conditions that </em><strong><em>stabilize student populations</em></strong><em> at individual schools?</em></li><li><em>How do we </em><strong><em>ensure successful grade level transitions</em></strong><em> to middle and high school?&nbsp;</em></li></ul>

<h2><strong>Reorganization Advisory Committee: Meeting 3 Recap</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On April 14, the Rebuilding Stronger community process continued with the third meeting of the reorganization advisory committee — this meeting focused on IPS enrollment trends. The core question we asked was, “Do all students have access to the variety of schools and programs offered?” The goal of the meeting was for all attendees to have a clear picture of the current IPS enrollment and choice landscape, and then for committee members to spend time sharing reflections in reaction to the data — and offer wonderings about how we can make access for all a reality.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/699874956">Watch the full meeting <strong>HERE</strong></a> or keep reading below for a summary and a better understanding of enrollment at IPS.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>The Context&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Our neighborhood schools are facing exactly the same trends as every other major national district in the wake of COVID19 — disappearing kids in our K–8 district neighborhood schools and a flight to charter schools.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></div></div>
<!-- /wp:media-text -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At the same time, <strong>we’re seeing some wins</strong>:&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Overall enrollment is increasing throughout our family of IPS schools, including district choice, innovation choice, and innovation neighborhood schools.</li><li>We continue to be a national model for the availability of choice programs and competition in our district.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Yet the reality is that not every family has access to an excellent choice in their neighborhood</strong>. Meeting 3 was a deep dive into our enrollment trends — both the opportunities and the challenges.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h2><strong>Data Overview: Key Trends</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>IPS faces <strong>significant competition</strong> from townships, charters, and private schools.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Enrollment at choice schools is increasing</strong>, while <strong>enrollment at neighborhood schools is decreasing.&nbsp;</strong></li><li><strong>Choice schools have significantly higher stability</strong> than neighborhood schools, retaining their students year-over-year better than other schools.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Student enrollment by race varies widely</strong> across IPS’ family of schools.</li><li>K–8 Choice schools continue to <strong>serve fewer families of color </strong>than neighborhood schools.&nbsp;</li></ul>

<h2><strong>Challenges We Must Address:</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Retention:</strong> Retention from 6<sup>th</sup> to 7<sup>th</sup> grade has been decreasing over the past few years, and more students are transferring to private and township schools.</li><li><strong>Race Equity:</strong> K–8 choice schools continue to serve fewer students of color than K–8 neighborhood schools. High demand choice schools are struggling to diversify and represent the overall demographics of the district.</li><li><strong>Not all students have the same access: </strong>High demand choice enrollment is driven by sibling and proximity enrollment priorities.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Mobility: </strong>Family selections and changes in circumstances during the pandemic (like a move) are playing a significant role in decreasing enrollment at neighborhood schools.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list --></div></div>
<!-- /wp:media-text -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>Opportunities to Build From&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>National recognition:</strong> IPS is known as a national leader on choice and collaboration — leveraging strategic partnerships across the city, and making choosing IPS schools an attractive option.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Enrollment increases</strong>: Enrollment at choice schools is increasing, creating a roadmap to build on what works.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Future school-age population growth:</strong> IPS has an opportunity to capitalize on increasing school-aged populations over the next decade.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Improve retention:</strong> There is an opportunity to increase retention from 6<sup>th</sup> to 7<sup>th</sup> grade by making quality options available to more students.&nbsp;</li></ul>

<h3>Demographic Analyses</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>(see slides 24-29)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>What do you notice about the data?</strong><ul><li>Proximity boundary drives access to specific schools.</li><li>Disproportionate # of white students at choice schools.</li><li>Choice schools over enroll white students W/R/T IPS demographics – opposite is true for neighborhood schools W/R/T families of color.</li><li>Growth in neighborhood schools is Latino/Hispanic.</li><li>White students are not attending IPS schools proportionate to population – LATINX is the opposite (2-3X proportion).</li><li>Choice underutilized by students of color – white families at higher % in choice.</li><li>Notable increase in enrollment of Latino students.</li><li>Increase of Hispanic enrollment, decrease of black student enrollment and white stays pretty steady.</li></ul></li><li><strong>What does the data make you wonder?</strong><ul><li>What obstacles and policies are we self-imposing to cause these discrepancies?</li><li>Why has IPS allowed the inequitable lottery practices to continue?</li><li>Can application process be more accessible/evenly diverse?</li><li>Is information about choice reaching non-white students – access to resources?</li><li>Is access to transportation an obstacle for those wanting to enter a choice school?</li><li>Are white students more willing and able to leave neighborhood schools due to access to non-IPS transport?</li><li>I am wondering why we have not discussed the noticeable increase in enrollment of Latino students as we talk about racial equity.</li><li>To what extent will IPS consider fully transitioning to choice model? What would that mean for families who enroll late?</li><li>How do we get info on choice to all families of color so that they have the same access?</li></ul></li><li><strong>What additional information or questions do you have after reviewing the data?</strong><ul><li><strong>What policies can be cut? What is our will to cut?</strong><ul><li><em>Any of our lottery policies not required by state or federal law can be changed, and the Rebuilding Stronger initiative is an opportunity to look at what we should change. We’ll continue to explore our broader community’s desire for change throughout this spring, summer, and early fall.</em> </li></ul></li><li><strong>Is IPS providing equitable funding for neighborhood schools?</strong><ul><li><em>IPS budgets using a resource allocation method called Student Based Allocation. One of the guiding principles of this formula is to promote equitable funding across schools based on characteristics of student need. We moved to this method in the 2017–2018 school year and continue to make greater strides towards equity. </em></li></ul></li><li><strong>How much is the cost difference in teaching a neighborhood student versus choice? What is allocation of funds at each school type?</strong><ul><li><em>On average, IPS spends ~$315.00 per student at choice schools on programmatic resources. Due to choice schools having higher than average enrollment their total dollar-per-pupil allocations are closely aligned with the district average.</em></li></ul></li><li><strong>Given that CFI is so popular, do we have data about how many families would be interested in the IB model?</strong><ul><li><em>CFI schools in any given year receive between 3 to 6 times the number of first-choice applicants as they have available seats, meaning that there are many more interested families than IPS is able to currently serve.</em></li></ul></li><li><strong>Will CFI and Butler Lab models be duplicated in other geographic areas to serve a more diverse population?</strong><ul><li><em>Two of the guiding principles in Rebuilding Stronger address this directly: “Ensure equitable geographic distribution of high performing &amp; high demand programming” and “Grow and replicate schools/programs with demonstrated academic success in supporting all students to both improve under-performing schools and explicitly close the opportunity gap for students of color.” While no decisions have been made, we are beginning to think about various ways to fulfill these guiding principles. </em></li></ul></li><li><strong>Have we studied to what extent Black and Latino families are interested in enrolling their students in the CFI and Butler Lab models?</strong><ul><li><em>Enroll Indy’s application data shows that overall applicants to CFI and Butler Lab schools are much more diverse by race than the students who are accepted into the schools. The data presented on 4/14 shows that this difference is primarily driven by sibling and proximity priorities, but it also means that families of color, although often not able to win a seat in the lottery, do want to enroll in these popular programs. </em></li></ul></li><li><strong>Will IPS change sibling/proximity enrollment policies, given that they appear to exacerbate existing inequities?</strong><ul><li><em>One of the guiding principles in Rebuilding Stronger addresses this directly: “Address inequities that may exist in the school proximity boundary policy.” We haven’t made any decisions yet for the future plan, but are thinking about ways to address the guiding principle.</em> </li></ul></li><li><strong>What is the process of getting info on choice to all parents?</strong><ul><li><em>Currently, IPS and Enroll Indy work collaboratively to spread the word about the choice lottery process and choice schools to all families. Students in transition grades (Pre-K, 6th grade at K–6 schools, and 8th grade) hear about school options and the lottery process directly from their school, and IPS and Enroll Indy track and follow up with families that have not participated in the lottery (families can apply to choice and neighborhood schools through the Enroll Indy lottery). IPS and Enroll Indy also partner with community organizations and daycare centers to reach out to younger families.</em></li></ul></li><li><strong>Are parents aware?</strong><ul><li><em>See above, but not all families participate in the lottery process. Others may decide not to participate because they want to enroll in their neighborhood school and don’t need to participate in the lottery.</em></li></ul></li><li><strong>How is neighborhood gentrification playing into this?</strong><ul><li><em>For as long as the lottery process advantages families based on their address (proximity priority), a family’s ability to afford a house near to a high-demand choice school will influence their chances of earning a seat in the lottery. We have seen housing prices increase across all of the IPS district, but some of the neighborhoods near our highest-demand programs have seen a particularly sharp increase in housing value.</em></li></ul></li><li><strong>Will the lottery system be revisited?</strong><ul><li><em>IPS has the ability to revisit the lottery rules at any time, and Rebuilding Stronger presents a particularly clear opportunity to think about what changes might need to be made to the lottery process. One of the guiding principles in Rebuilding Stronger addresses this directly: “Address inequities that may exist in the school proximity boundary policy.”</em></li></ul></li><li><strong>How do you take into consideration family structure and dynamics – families in need of resources? How do we support them in being able to get to the choice school?</strong><ul><li><em>IPS has made multiple changes to the choice enrollment process that have all increased access for low income families and for families of color. These changes include (1) a transition from a paper-based application to an online and a phone-based application, (2) the introduction of multiple application rounds with seats held back for distribution in later rounds, and (3) the reduction of proximity boundaries from 1.5 miles to .5 miles. All of these changes increased access for families from low-income backgrounds and for families of color, but the data presented on 4/14 shows that we still have an opportunity to achieve greater equity of access.</em></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul>

One of the most powerful examples of a partnership that has resulted in decreased family transiency is between the John Boner Neighborhood Center and Thomas Gregg Neighborhood School 15. The work that the Boner Center does to help house and stabilize families within the School 15 boundary has significantly decreased family transience, which has positive impacts on student learning and school effectiveness. IPS is eager to expand on the success of these types of partnership with other community organizations.</em></li></ul></li><li><strong>Will changes/decisions/next steps be made in a timely manner to interrupt these trends and increase equitable access?</strong><ul><li><em>Yes. Rebuilding Stronger is a community-based initiative meant to reimagine IPS for the future, and the goal is to develop and implement a plan for the district that is grounded in the guiding principles developed by the IPS community.</em></li></ul></li><li><strong>When a student transitions at 7-8 they are choosing from choice – what role is K-6 transition affecting this change to choice?</strong><ul><li><em>Slide 37 of the enrollment presentation shows that K-6 schools, with the natural middle school transition point, has a much higher attrition rate than K-8 schools, without a natural middle school transition point. 34% of 6th grade students at K-6 schools leave the district, compared to just 15% of 6th grade students at K-8 schools who leave the district.</em></li></ul></li><li><strong>How does the district support students and families through the transition from one school to another (i.e. 6th to 7th)?</strong><ul><li><em>IPS works directly with families at transition points. Schools make sure families are educated about their school options, and schools and Enroll Indy track and follow up with families to encourage all families to apply as early as possible.</em></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Addressing our budget — and directing funds to our highest priority — is key to delivering our vision of IPS as a family of excellent public schools in which every student has the opportunity to succeed and the power to create their own future.&nbsp;</span></i></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><b>Reorganization Advisory Committee: Meeting 4 Summary</b></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On April 27th, the Rebuilding Stronger community process continued with the fourth meeting of the reorganization advisory committee — this one focused on financial sustainability. The goal of this discussion was for all attendees to have a clear understanding of the current IPS financial picture.&nbsp;</span></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As Dr. Johnson made clear in her State of the District, IPS’s budget line is headed in the wrong direction. The literal bottom line is that, if we change nothing, we’ll go into the red in 2028. In the same way that your family might sit around the dinner table to look at costs, weigh priorities, and decide trade offs, Dr. Johnson promised the community would come together to dive into the data, weigh values and trade offs, and recommend changes. This meeting was an important part of that conversation. </span><a href="https://vimeo.com/705061415"><span style="font-weight: 400">You can watch the full meeting</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">or keep reading below for more information.&nbsp;</span></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><b>The Context&nbsp;</b></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In 2018, the IPS community generously supported an Operating Referendum with the primary purpose of investing in teachers and leaders. Over the past several years, IPS leaders kept our commitment to that purpose:</span></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">We've built supports for high-need students;&nbsp;</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">We’ve invested in high-quality curriculum;&nbsp;</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">And we’ve given essential raises to staff.</span></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">These investments are unarguably vital, but they also increased our costs. At the same time, our revenue is going down. Why?</span></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"right","id":254683,"width":430,"height":195,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-full is-resized"><img src="https://myips.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Screen-Shot-2022-04-28-at-12.57.28-PM.png" alt="" class="wp-image-254683" width="430" height="195" /></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li style="font-weight: 400"><b>Declining state funding:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> Funding from the state hasn’t kept up, because much larger increases have gone to districts with significantly less poverty. Statewide, Total Tuition Support has increased 21% since 2013–14, while the IPS share has grown only 6%.&nbsp;</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400"><b>Declining enrollment in neighborhood schools:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> Even though our total operating expense remains at 2014-15 levels, declining enrollment in traditional schools has driven per-pupil spending up by $2,200, or 20%.</span></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><b>What we’ve been doing</b></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We’ve been working hard to offset increasing costs — and decreasing revenue — including through reductions at the Central Office. We’ve also:&nbsp;</span></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li style="font-weight: 400"><b>Reduced the number of underutilized buildings</b><span style="font-weight: 400">, which has generated $25 million in one-time proceeds since 2017 as well as an annual reduction in ongoing facility maintenance.</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400"><b>Implemented transportation initiatives</b><span style="font-weight: 400">, like a fuel efficient bus fleet, route optimization, walk zones, and our partnership with IndyGo, which have generated $52 million in savings since 2017.&nbsp;</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400"><b>Modernized systems, better monitored utilities, and controlled health care costs</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> while increasing access to quality providers.&nbsp;</span></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But the brutal reality is that this isn’t enough to get our budget to a sustainable level.&nbsp;</span></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><b>So, what else can we do?&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"right","id":254682,"width":322,"height":307,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-full is-resized"><img src="https://myips.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Screen-Shot-2022-04-28-at-12.58.43-PM.png" alt="" class="wp-image-254682" width="322" height="307" /></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><b>Here’s the key thing to know:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> There is a significant relationship between the number of schools we have, the number of students that we serve, the number of staff we employ, and our funding. So when we have underutilized schools, declining enrollment in neighborhood schools, and rising costs in our schools, that all impacts our budget.&nbsp;</span></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That means, just like any budget, we need to look at what’s driving our costs and what’s creating revenue. We can cut expenses, grow our revenue, or some combination of both — but everything involves trade offs:&nbsp;</span></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><b>Main Drivers of IPS Revenue:</b></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Student enrollment</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Property tax</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">State tuition support</span></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><b>Main Drivers of IPS Expenses:</b></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><span style="font-weight: 400">Compensation</span></li><li><span style="font-weight: 400">Transportation</span></li><li><span style="font-weight: 400">Facilities</span></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><b>Join the Conversation: We need YOU to help us reinvent, rebuild, redesign!</b></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No decisions are made, and we need to hear from you.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2><b>ICYMI: What is the Reorganization Advisory Committee?</b></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This committee is made up of parents and students, teachers and school leaders, Board members and other elected officials, community organizations and nonprofits, and the business community. The committee is tasked with reviewing and discussing assessments on facilities, student experience, enrollment and choice, and finances to provide IPS with feedback and recommendations.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guiding Principle: Ensure all students have access to high-quality and rigorous curriculum and instruction, PLUS access to enrichment programming and athletic offerings.</span></i></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><b>Reorganization Advisory Committee: Meeting 5 Summary</b></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On May 19, the Rebuilding Stronger community process continued with the fifth meeting of the reorganization advisory committee, covering our final topic in this series: </span><b>IPS Student Experience</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&nbsp;</span></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As IPS Superintendent Dr. Aleesia Johnson made clear in her State of the District in fall 2021, everyone in the IPS community should have access to a school that “no one would see as a risk, or a sacrifice, or a trade-off. A school that any family would be delighted to send their children to because everything about that school communicated to their child their inherent value and worth. All that. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">In every neighborhood and every school in Indianapolis Public Schools.” </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">That means we need to rebuild the student experience — to ensure access to high-quality academics PLUS enrichments and athletics in all of our schools.&nbsp;</span></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://vimeo.com/719964242">For access to the recording of Meeting 5, see the video.</a></span></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><b>The Cost of Small Schools</b></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We started off the session with a deep-dive into the cost of running small schools: Small schools spend $1,500 more per pupil than non-small schools. Why? Because the fixed costs associated with “running a school” means that our smaller schools that cover more grade bands (K-8, instead of K-5, for example) have fewer dollars to spread to the classroom level. And that impacts what we are able to offer as part of the student experience in small schools:&nbsp;</span></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our K-8 choice schools serve, on average, 25% more students per school than our K-8 neighborhood schools and are able to offer students twice as many enrichment opportunities.&nbsp;</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our K-6 schools, on average, serve 25% fewer students per school than our K-8 schools, and are able to offer only 40% the number of enrichment experiences to students.&nbsp;</span></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><b>What we want to offer every student</b></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As it stands today, our elementary school principals are often forced to make choices that they shouldn’t have to — between art, music, technology or physical education. Most schools can afford only to do one or two of those, especially the small schools. Our high schools can’t offer the diversity of advanced courses and athletic offerings that set students up for college. We know our constrained offerings don’t allow us to create the best conditions to cultivate the many strengths and interests our children have. It’s limiting, at a very early stage, and we want to change this. We’ve heard from the community a desire for every school to provide access to enrichment programs, access to athletics, and access to upper level math coursework.&nbsp;</span></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><b>Access to Enrichment Programs&nbsp;</b></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">On average, our high schools offer twice as many in-day enrichment classes as our K-8 schools. Our 7-8 schools offer less than our K-8 schools, and our K-6 schools offer the least.&nbsp;</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students at our K-8 choice schools have access to over twice as many enrichment classes as students in our neighborhood K-8 schools.&nbsp;</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">On average, our IPS-run choice schools are able to offer students over three times the number of in-day enrichment classes as our neighborhood schools.</span></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><b>Access to Athletic Offerings</b></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">While every school can access all 10 of our IPS athletic offerings, overall our schools offer an average of 6.</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">On average, an IPS 7-8 middle school offers 9 athletic programs while a neighboring township offers 13 athletic programs at their middle school.&nbsp;</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both the demand and opportunity to staff athletic programs vary by school enrollment. For example, at one of our 7-8 buildings, the total number of students is 6 times the amount of the 7-8 students at one K-8 building.&nbsp;</span></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><b>Access to Upper Level Math Coursework</b></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students in Grades 7-8 have inconsistent access to advanced coursework math, depending on the school that they attend.</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of the 12 schools that offer Algebra I, 11 of them are choice schools and 1 is a neighborhood school.</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of the 12 schools that offer Algebra I, 2 of them serve a population of students that is above the District’s median BIPOC population percentage.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li></ul>

<p><em>We can do hard things together. We can do </em>anything. <em>But we can’t do </em>everything.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><strong>Reorganization Advisory Committee: Meeting 6 Summary</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On June 23, the Rebuilding Stronger Reorganization Advisory Committee met to recap where we’ve been, and pivot from the data story to <strong>potential solutions. </strong>Participants first aligned around a shared statement of what the community most values, and then provided feedback on potential solutions — both the benefits and the tradeoffs. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><strong>Our Values</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over the course of the past year, we heard a lot of feedback about what this community most values — and we kicked off this meeting presenting the following summary statement of values:&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Every child in Indianapolis must have what it takes to grow and succeed. </strong>That means three things:&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol><li><strong>Excellent, more equitable choices for learning, including academics, athletics, and arts, that are accessible to more students. </strong>Rigorous, challenging, culturally representative curriculum. An orderly, safe, fair learning environment. A commitment to learn from every school model that works well for kids.</li><li><strong>Supports that see every child as a whole child with a full range of human needs,</strong> not just an academic learner. Wraparound supports that every family can access.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Warm, safe, well-kept buildings that promote learning,</strong> including inviting outdoor spaces.</li></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><strong>Data Recap&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here’s a quick reminder of what the community process has covered to date:&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><a href="https://myips.org/rebuilding-stronger-community-conversations/rebuilding-stronger-phase-2-summary/rebuilding-stronger-meeting-4-financial-sustainability/"><strong>Finances</strong></a></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><em>What the data shows:</em></strong> </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>IPS must make bold, strategic decisions to ensure financial sustainability over time. Doing nothing is not an option — we will go into the red.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><em>What you said:</em>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>“District will go bankrupt without intervention and/or referendum.”</li><li>“IPS is NOT receiving the resources it needs — schools, students and families are not receiving what they need.”&nbsp;</li><li>“Will we be able to not only sustain the district but also produce an equitable system?”</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><a href="https://myips.org/rebuilding-stronger-community-conversations/rebuilding-stronger-phase-2-summary/rebuilding-stronger-meeting-2-facilities/"><strong>Facilities</strong></a></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><em>What the data shows:</em></strong><em> </em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We have many small, underutilized schools — which cost more, and leave limited dollars for enrichments. We also have many buildings with low composite scores: It would cost ~$466 million to bring all district buildings to a condition of “good” or better.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><em>What you said:</em></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>“Good number of buildings are underutilized; seems like there would be an opportunity to redistribute and take advantage.”</li><li>“If we know small schools cost more per pupil to operate, why do they remain open?”</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><a href="https://myips.org/rebuilding-stronger-community-conversations/rebuilding-stronger-phase-2-summary/rebuilding-stronger-meeting-3-enrollment/"><strong>Enrollment and Choice:</strong></a></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><em>What the data shows:</em></strong><em> </em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Choice enrollment is increasing, neighborhood enrollment is decreasing; Choice stability is high, neighborhood stability is low. High demand choice schools are serving fewer students of color over time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><em>What you said:</em></strong><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>“How do we replicate the choice school experience?”</li><li>“There is a large disparity between choice and neighborhood.”&nbsp;</li><li>“Will IPS change sibling/proximity policies, given that they appear to exacerbate existing inequities?”</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><a href="https://myips.org/rebuilding-stronger-community-conversations/rebuilding-stronger-phase-2-summary/rebuilding-stronger-meeting-5-student-experience/"><strong>Student Experience</strong></a></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><em>What the data shows:</em></strong> </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>IPS spends more on ensuring all schools can operate and therefore has less to focus on equity and enhancing student experience. This disproportionately impacts students of color, who are more likely to attend small schools. Larger schools tend to have more enrichment offerings.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><em>What you said:</em></strong><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>“Strong programs give students incentives to come to school and be successful in school.”&nbsp;</li><li>“Data shows neighborhood schools with low enrollment have less offerings.”</li><li>“Does it have to be about choice v. neighborhood? Can’t we just offer more enrichment programs at neighborhood schools?”</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><strong>Potential Solutions</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Having a complete picture of the data — plus community feedback — puts us in a position to move to potential solutions designed to bring our actions, our plans, and our budget in line with our values. During the session, we proposed ways to better align our resources to our values and our priorities. Remember: We can do anything, but we can’t do everything. And it’s got to be equitable.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Working together, these potential solutions offer a way to provide more equitable access to high-demand and higher-quality schools in more neighborhoods. <strong>Click on the PowerPoint below to learn more about each potential option; what it does; why it’s on the table; and what it could look like in practice in schools.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>culture.”… then you’ll respect I vehemently disagree with this plan that IPS has proposed.</li><li>K-8 at School 91 is a community and a culture of positivity. Jr. High is a rough age. I stayed in IPS for School 91’s culture and community for the K-8 atmosphere that embraces ethnic and economic diversity in the promotion of Montessori methods. Children are flourishing in 91. I suggest your plan instead revamps failing schools who lack funding and parental support. I’d likely move out of IPS district if this plan comes to fruition.</li><li>IPS definitely has an equity problem in schools</li><li>I agree schools are more than test scores.</li><li>It's true. There's a lot inequity in education that usually results in poorer outcomes for children of color and poor children. The change that is required to make these changes will be hard, and people who are most able to independently able to make changes to how and where their child is educated will likely scream the loudest, but the focus needs to be on ensuring all children have access to an equitable education.</li><li>Love, love, love that you’re getting rid of the proximity zone. I do hope you’ll keep sibling priority just to make transportation easier on families. I am open to the idea of consolidating and making separate middle schools instead of K-8 but it would be nice if curricula were continued at designated middle schools ie CFI middle school, Montessori middle school, etc. Also I’ve heard a lot of negative feedback about what happened in the 90s when IPS tried to do separate middle schools. Lots of disorganization and families fleeing to private schools. That does make me a bit nervous.</li><li>People value their strong communities. The community is an extension of home.</li><li>That closing k-8 schools to divide them up makes no sense as the writing supports not closing schools and keeping people/communities together.</li><li>Interested, but not terribly informative for this activity and the proposals being considered.</li><li>I want the schools to be more equitable. I do NOT want to move away from the K-8 model!</li><li>Very interesting read and makes me want to read the entire book</li><li>I don’t want to model anything after Chicago, it is a corrupt, broke city that is currently under siege. That comes from a former resident of the city.</li><li>While schools provide great access they are created and fostered by the community around them.</li><li>Sounds like an interesting book, not sure this particular article really offers any ideas of actual action…?</li><li>That my level.of education about the subject is far away from offering anything genuinely constructive to this conversation</li><li>I think it sounds similar to what IPS has been encountering for several years. A lot of schools are struggling and definitely need refigured</li><li>How can we improve the schools that we have and encourage attendance instead of closing them</li><li>Honestly, I'm a bit frustrated after reading that. I taught at Fuller School, a Chicago Public School, in Bronzeville from 2004 to 2006. We were a school on the chopping block for a long time. We fought for our school and for our children, but were never given the tools or leadership we deserved.</li><li>I'm frustrated because I've watched IPS since arriving in Indianapolis in 2014. They have turned over so many schools to charters in the name of "innovation," without school and community support (Stand for Children doesn't count and we all know that). IPS does whatever they want and pretends like the community has a voice. Bring the real issues that Indianapolis is dealing with and let's make decisions together.</li><li>No one wants their neighborhood school to close. Having read The Bee Eater ( a true story of a really good and reform minded principal who gets hosed by her DC school system) and having been in IPS for 55 years I understand the importance of great leadership by principals and how school systems can and do screw good things up.</li><li>It's true that people don't like change and that I understand it's a scary thing to close down a neighborhood school, even one that has been failing for a while.</li><li>It seems vague- the author seems to indicate closing schools is bad for the culture and history of a neighborhood, but also sometimes necessary. I fully agree that schools for a huge part of a neighborhoods identity and often reflect it back into the community. But if they are neglected, physically or educationally, what is to be done?</li><li>Why are you giving a reading assignment for a survey?</li><li>She looks into the 50 Chicago school closings in 2013 from the perspective of students and family most effected. This a necessary perspective to more fully understand the situation. It's not a comprehensive look into the school closings and thus does not include other reasons and effects of the school closings. Eve Ewing didn't intend to study the whole picture but instead and correctly so looks deeply into one aspect of the closings.</li><li>I think that anyone who doesn’t think that racism, money, power, weaponized Christianity and white supremacy doesn’t impact public schools isn’t paying attention</li><li>Schools are vital neighborhood anchors that help communities stay connected.</li><li>I feel it’s a bit leading toward a particular mindset you’re looking to cultivate.</li><li>I thought this was a survey?</li><li>There are major inequalities with the education system as it stands and this needs to be changed. Those are structural and stem from centuries old policies that intend to keep the poor right where they are so their time and resources can be exploited. Schools are more than an education, they are a space for shared learning, community, and connection.</li><li>I thought this pre-read is a barrier to many families being able to provide input and give their opinion.</li><li>I feel there are some interesting and valid points. However, without actually reading the book and in-depth points, speaking on those points would be elementary in my thinking and/or opinions.</li><li>Honest answer: You expect me to read an entire book to fill out this survey? Ok but this might take awhile… real answer: I think this is a real concern and even the article touches on the fact that the problem is bigger than what just the board and school district can address. Funding, shifting populations, and unreasonable rules and laws all play a part as well and are even harder to change. I've been part of a closing school and I've watches my elementary school be bulldozed and rebuilt. It is HARD to see your school close even if you knew it had problems.</li><li>Answering the question of what school reform is appropriate is difficult and entails factors that stakeholders within the school district may be uncomfortable addressing.</li><li>That IPS has been challenged in some areas of the city, which area reasons we have charter schools and innovation schools</li><li>That the traditional school model doesn’t work</li><li>You’re using a book review as background or the actual book? This doesn’t make sense.</li><li>It tracks with my experiences as a school teacher at a second-chance high school in the South Bronx, and working with students from the South Side of Chicago. Education outcomes often are blind to the multi-faceted nature of the factors that create them. Excellent schools can be considered failing when compared against their more affluent peers. And the best schools, especially in under-resourced communities, are more than merely a place for learning, but double as community centers becoming an open-access gathering place for all. Whether to close a "failing" school is a decision that must be undertaken with great care, and the impact on the community needs to be determined holistically.</li><li>I’m a little surprised because it does not feel like communities always value school except as a place for free lunch and childcare.</li><li>I believe that equity in schools/school systems is a real problem but am not sure there is one way to fix it.</li><li>No! As an educator and parent we chose our Montessori school because it taught the whole child AND it was a k-8 opportunity. We value that our kids get to grow and learn with the same educators and peers for 9 years. If you are looking to build schools that are safe and welcoming for students and families there isn't a better opportunity than this. Replicate the k-8 program in buildings rather than giving families the opportunity to jump ship from IPS during Middle School, like they often do for their high school choices.</li><li>Another race baiting article from IPS</li><li>?</li><li>That people fight for "failing" schools?</li><li>Schools are connected to their communities and should continue to be supported to encourage broad acceptance and attendance to them from those who live around them and throughout the broad community. However, schools have been inequitably impacted based on political, social and economic prejudices, therefore leading to unfortunate evaluations based on standards written by the same individuals who are deciding those inequities.</li><li>That closing schools robs communities of a key component of their child's stability</li><li>Very interesting.</li><li>Closing schools is a travesty. It uproots a core sense of stability for any child in attendance. I very much understand the sense of a school being more than just test scores.

But without achievement on tests and grades they are failing their fundamental purpose in society.</li><li>It captures the challenge we face with public schools today</li><li>Schools are personal places where students, parents and community often find a sense of belonging. Closing schools is difficult for communities and can strip them of a place that is essential to their identities. At the same time, there are practical reasons it should be considered.</li><li>I think it is a powerful example of how there are not easy answers. Most often issues cannot be confronted in a simple binary way. There is going to be a lot of nuance to solving the issues that any school system finds itself in, including IPS.</li><li>I do not feel qualified to answer questions about the review because I haven't read the book.</li><li>Closing schools that are homes to neighborhoods and families can be detrimental to the entire community.</li><li>Closing schools is not necessarily good</li><li>It's only a book review, not a book. It is not particularly clear what your point was in including it, as you are suggesting closing schools, and the subject of the book is families fighting against the closing of schools. I find it particularly interesting that the review mentions the intersection of power and politics in our communities, and suggest that we should all be fighting to keep out-of-state big-business charter school power out of our schools and our school board elections.</li><li>I’ve taught in IN public schools for 19 years. There is disparity within more affluent nearby districts. Parent involvement, monetary support, quality instruction are all important but a sense of community within neighborhood school is strongest factor.</li><li>That parents want schools in their neighborhoods that their children can attend.</li><li>Right on</li><li>Only a person who is new to race and to Chicago, the most segregated city in the U.S. for decades, and one that has had failed public schools for at least 50 years, would think this instructive for Indianapolis. This is insulting to use in this context.</li><li>My initial reaction was feeling sad for the students whose schools were closed and had that safe space in their life disrupted. The question posed in the article is valid - what should be done to schools that fail to educate their students? I was hoping for some solutions to be offered but it was more of a statement that no one knows the answer to that question.</li><li>I was sad to see that IPs is considering grade reconfiguration. Our school, CFi2 and other K-8 schools offer very special bonds between the older and younger grades. If we decide to strip all schools of this grade configuration, we are damaging unbroken systems that parents know and love about our school and others like this. I have two kids, 3rd and 5th and they both enjoy having the mentorship of older students and also enjoy the ability to offer or eventually offer the same mentorship to kids you get at some point in their k-8 experience. We have many broken systems but this is not one of them. This solution would be detrimental to those students thrust into a new building or system and cause great strain on parents to serve on committee or volunteer in schools when kids are split by building due to their grade. I would be deeply sadden if this decision is made without consulting with students, faculty and parents of schools this model serves well.</li><li>Schools are vital to our communities and parents will do whatever we can to protect our schools and children's education.</li><li>Unfortunately, it appears to be yet another misguided attempt to inject racial politics and racial division into our schools.</li><li>I appreciate the approach of seeing schools as more than just test scores and attendance. How can we evaluate the success of schools differently?</li><li>No matter what changes are made it going to be a hard road for many.</li><li>N/a</li><li>I thought it was insightful to learn how parents and families are often devoted to their schools. It's not as simple as test scores and facility condition.</li><li>Curiosity about the different ways society reacts to a lack of contributions to the community and the way our own personal lenses about our collective identities often are more dependent on satiation of our own adult egos than embracing evidence-based practices centered on improving the lives of children. Another reaction I had was one of ironic laughter remembering when our superintendent ran on the premise of being a proponent of school choice. Having lied to gain power and influence, believing whole heartedly she was doing the right thing, I think about parallels to injustices of generations past. I think about how people with loyalty devotions over justice devotions regularly exhibit behaviors and opinions history typically doesn’t look down fondly on, and I think about this strange idea that the standards that shouldn’t have mattered to measure public schools and how they now matter when comparing charters to public schools. I think about this bizarre belief that it is somehow freedom to force children to attend their school district even when they may face physical danger doing so. I think about how we frame this as an issue predicating in the freedom and free exchange of ideas, and not many people find the obvious lack of freedom in telling someone “if you don’t like it but you’re rich, you have options. If you’re poor…..you better learn how to like it.” I find it interesting the same people acting as if it is about democracy and not money are the people who “raised” about 3x the median wage of an average Hoosier for the school board campaign. I am fascinated about how my fancy friends with master’s degrees and PhDs feel as if they’re making an impact by sending their kids to public school as if it is some great sacrifice, and in the same breath hiring private teachers and tutors to make up for the lack of information and critical thought abilities their kids miss out on BECAUSE THEY CAN AFFORD TO DO THAT. I, for one, find it disingenuous to subsidize public schools and make children feel less than by pretending the school did its job when I paid private school tuition to a private tutor and skewing the data. I am lucky enough to have the self-awareness to find this all amusing in spite of having a child having to live through the travesties of what we decided counted as education during covid. Because I’ve been poor, because I work full time, and because I grew up in a family who experienced poverty until my mother was lucky enough to catch a break finding a job in a union that invested in her education (as they simultaneously stole her membership dues to pay for their 3rd vacation property), I understand that it’s not realistic to get a ‘good’ (read: desired) result without being as dirty as the lying politicians who typically call the shots. I see the benefits of providing what someone out there considers valuable, I see the importance of public education, but I am also not so full of myself to believe that my child’s sacrifice will save the world (I remember going to public school with a kid whose mom was a judge….she actively fought to keep ‘new kids’ out of the gifted and talented program because ‘this group of kids is a community! They grew up together! They’re like family!’ in spite of superior test scores than the students who were currently enrolled—this is kind of like what charter schools are now, but this is HUMAN NATURE. I do not believe we can change human nature. That same urge to have a nice brand of shoes or a fancy bag is the same urge people have to dominate others, and pretending not to be guilty of it just makes you look like you have NO self-awareness at all. I am FULLY aware that people do NOT like opening their circles to other socioeconomic classes regardless of ability, and this was one of my first intense lessons in the power of knowing important people, which was taught to me over and over throughout my adult life). As you, writer of this book, sit in your ivory tower writing with the alphabet soup after your name from one of the biggest engines of political power in the nation, rubbing shoulders with people who have power and control, and lecture us lowly mortals about how important it is that we give power and control to you because you know better than us and are smarter and better, you are not fooling anyone. Nearly every adult realizes the world isn’t meritbased, and we all know everything is driven by relationship. Everything is based on who you know and whether they like or respect you. It is human nature to prioritize and protect those we like over that which is right, and loyalty is obviously more valuable to most people than truth. I can’t help but chuckle when I put this all into the context of the fact that the only people who really get to participate in the public school “democracy” still somehow wind up being the wealthy stay at home parents or the perpetual students who haven’t ever held—or needed to hold—a real full time job, speaking for us lowly know nothings about what is good for the brains of our children. It’s almost as if it has always been about money or class or something?!?! Insane! Who could have ever predicted that all of this was about money…. The funny part is that with the advent of the internet, the only thing now aside from degrees and certificates that separates the haves from the have nots is their interpersonal relationships and ability to ask good questions—and it seems like so few anymore have self-awareness. With information so widely accessible, easily available, it is becoming clear that what you all have convinced yourselves was hard-won merit (earned through your superior abilities and blood, sweat, and tears) is actually just inheritance of relationships, and people realize it, and you don’t have to keep acting so self-important. Out of curiosity, can you name one singular example of a time where forcing a citizenry to do something after lying about the intentions was looked upon as good or necessary after the fact? Would I have considered the shuttering of my first ever job in high school an erasure of my history of the business not only lost money but also maybe even actively harmed the population it was supposed to have been serving? If the ice cream shop I worked at served lead-laced ice cream, but meant well, would people have the ability to recognize that my intentions are irrelevant to the actual impact that would have on the people buying the ice cream? Also, there is a direct link between economic stability and math abilities. Inability to think critically and, from evidence-based research (whether people put the subjective label of racist on this or not), in a linear, mathematical fashion is a great way to increase the likelihood your children experience poverty. I can’t help but wonder why there are schools in areas with high levels of poverty that actually help develop pro social behaviors in children—what do they know that we don’t know? Is it possible our desire to control kids and call memorization of facts (that anyone could look up with WiFi access or a library card) “education” when we ourselves have no interest in thinking critically outside of our own egos and desire to be important, right, or good? Is it possible that Chicago’s tradition of political corruption is the perfect example of what people think the uneducated are unable to see, when all along, they’ve actually just been too grossed out by the prospect or not shallow enough to care about the feelings of importance you place value on by knowing the right people? Maybe creativity, likability, business acumen is actually more important than intelligence? Is it possible the people who don’t devote their lives to chasing money or power aren’t less enlightened than you, but just different from you? Can self sustainability be the goal so that our kids aren’t forever a slave to this system you and your friends at these prestigious institutions pretend to be victimized by but continue to engage in the same loyalty and personal relationship-driven approach to exclusion that happened by those who don’t look/talk/act like you? Teaching kids to play the weird long game, pretend to value merit, and suck up to the right egos can be the band-aid, but please for all that is good and holy, keep the condescension to a minimum. The only thing that will save our society is the acknowledgement that life is a series of tests about how willing to engage in relationships with people you can’t stand being around for large sums of money so that your kids can learn how to do the same thing without experiencing the constant existential dread that comes from mandatory participation in the theater of it all. Our world will be a better place when you quit pretending your cause is more noble than that and just admit it.</li><li>interesting and disheartening</li><li>Raises important questions but doesn’t suggest answers</li><li>Unsure</li><li>That schools can perpetuate inequity and systemic racism.

I come from a school that was combined my senior year of high school it’s stressful and a lot of work but at the end of the day it was a better put come then keeping 2 high schools open in a small town! Our sports teams got better we had more money and opportunities come from combining the schools together. If you combine there is a lot that goes into but with the right mind set and resources it could happen. I live by bethel park and I can count in my neighborhood area there are at least 5 different schools we could make it into one school and put all those resources into one school instead of 5 schools in one area. The biggest thing about recovering is to know the plan or plans and move towards them and not let it just be something we talk about for years. I feel like all kids deserve the best education no matter where they life what color they are or what ethnicity they come from. Our children’s eduction is the number one thing that needs to be the focus then everything else.</li><li>I have listened to and read many things like this over the last 2 years.

The K-8 model has been praised to be extremely successful. 91 especially, as a past student of the school, I made it a priority to make sure my children were able to attend as well. When 91 was made into a k-5 school when I was in 5th grade it forced us to move out of district to attend Washington township for 6-8 middle school. Changing communities to a huge population was a detriment to my school experience. If this change were to be made again, our family would no longer attend the school and attend a different district, thus causing more of a problem of low enrollment and I believe this to be the case with many families. I have worked as an educator for 2 decades and we have “bussed” children of minority to our schools to have more diversity and not priority of the neighborhood. All this causes is a longer commute for children that are possibly already at a disadvantage causing even more concerns and behaviors to occur.</li><li>That we should be thoughtful in when and how to reorganize schools, knowing that the children and families that attend those schools are a part of an important and valuable community, in spite of what test scores might be at the school.</li><li>These are my thoughts around the proposed phase 6 direction. The k-8 model is highly effective. I truly believe the path to this key goal of the project- "Supports that see every child as a whole child with a full range of human needs" is much more attainable in small middle schools. I have experience or witnessed many of the other approaches over the years as a student and parent. I went to Shortridge when it was just 7-8 and remember trying 6-12 there as well. There were too many students and the community was not as strong as k-8. Reviewing the spreadsheet for many of the current k-6 schools it seems clear that most have the space to add 7-8. If the middle schools are failing we should expand the k-8 model to all students. The middle school at #91 is diverse and produces capable, confident students who excel in schools as big as North Central and as small as Riverside. I agree that proximity preferences should be eliminated and the zone concept implemented. The zone will help with transportation and the proximity preference elimination help with increasing access for students across the district. I also think that we should strongly consider a replication specifically of Montessori across the district. You know the history of the philosophy so it makes sense that it would be effective in a district like ours-especially in k-4. Also, I have witnessed our middle school and elementary have so many opportunities mostly driven by our athletic director (also MS teacher-best teacher ever Ms. Rebecca Pfaffenberger) and parents. If we dedicate funds to support positions that can focus on extracurricular as a primary role, the opportunity expansion will be easier to achieve in the k-8 model. Perhaps the money is best spent to support small enrollment schools in communities that need more school based support. Add middle school to these buildings, hire support staff in the form of teacher's assistants and extracurricular/sport managers, partner with community supports and work to make the budget meet the needs.</li><li>Very interesting. I agree that schools are so much more than just test scores and attendance data.</li><li>Interesting.</li><li>I think the challenges IPS is facing are complex and there is not an easy answer, which may have been similar to the situation in Chicago.</li><li>I feel really strongly that the K-8 model works - to avoid the transition to a new school in already difficult years lifts a huge burden off of students and parents alike. I would be frustrated to see my child's K-8 school split.</li><li>This will be a mistake.</li><li>As a Black parent of two Black sons at IPS, I do share the concerns of the author.</li><li>There is a lot that can be learned from missteps made in our history.</li><li>As a first generation American myself, I do value the public education and service IPS provides to tens of thousands of children and young adult who live in the district or chose to be a part of the district. It's not clear to me that in the pre-read, it points out "steers clear of offering blanket solutions" and the district seems to have proposed a blanket solution to many faceted needs of each school and each student in the district. Like the pre-read mentions, schools are "spaces that facilitate an under- standing of a shared past and culture". I believe Sidener Academy has represented that to my family. We chose to move our son into a school that seemed more equitable and more representative of the student/teacher body of IPS. Also the school has served many twice exceptional students in many different ways while keeping their accelerated academic needs which seems to be deep rooted in the students' twice-exceptional needs. Anyhow, I find the pre-read interesting but the district seems to be proposing something that's flying in the face of the pre-read rather than being sensitive and understanding each school and community's purpose and trying honor what's working and individualized approaches to make every school and student in the district better.</li><li>I was impressed by the statement about schools being so much more than test scores and attendance numbers. This is especially important as this work comes to fruition.</li><li>Why would we follow what CPS has done? They are not a great example to look at.</li><li>Interesting book review. What was purpose in sharing?</li><li>Community schools matter to the stakeholders in that community</li><li>I know there is not a "blanket solution" but we cannot take away our neighborhood schools. We also need to look at why families are leaving their schools that were created in the neighborhood that they grew up in. Look at Haughville, or the near Northside neighborhoods that have changed several times over the last seventy years.</li><li>The decision to close a school is extremely personal to those involved with the school on a daily basis. Their perspectives should hold as much weight as the budget.</li><li>I think we always need to think about how we can best teach our students, all students within the district. That might mean making restructuring changes and we need to consider the needs of all families.</li><li>This is an important reminder that we can't simply close schools as a way to achieve excellent education. Schools matter-- community and family integration matters.</li><li>I find it hard to understand the inequity because I have not experienced inequity of color. I do recognize it as a historical situation that is held onto. Any child from a lower income status does have a more difficult time in school. I believe it is because parents lack the skills required to help their child(ren) with the new and required standards. Parents are often unavailable to help with homework due to work schedules. I also believe with the influx of immigrants, the language and educational barrier creates a huge disparity</li><li>Yes! So why does IPS always jump to the closing schools solution?</li><li>What was the point of reading that? It was vague and superficial.</li><li>Frustrated - always changing. Not good for families with multiple kids - how would they go to multiple schools- Families should be kept together</li><li>directive of the conversation</li><li>That I can empathize with the families who didn't want their schools to be closed. That I wish school districts would genuinely listen to parents and make changes based on their feedback, rather than the more top down approach that typically happens--and I fear is already happening at IPS.</li><li>I like change for the most part and want to improve schools. But I don’t want to loose our neighborhood school 57. I also think poorly rated schools need better resources.</li><li>90% true</li><li>Another NO SOLUTIONS - JUST RACE BAIT FEARMONGERING</li><li>We should not close schools across the board based on test scores. Nor should we move to disband high achieving schools simply because they are in a less diverse neighborhood. We can make all neighborhood schools great.</li><li>Use it as a guide, but the experiences she shares may not be directly transferrable to our community. I think you are taking the first import step by listening to families and trying to create equity.</li><li>As a half gen (moved to USA as a kid), our schools are our communities. Splitting them in two will not benefit that community.</li><li>Best to build good schools but not by destroying current good schools</li><li>Focus on schools who are failing versus changing everything about IPS structure.</li><li>Involve communities and families affected in the decisions</li><li>Consider the value to community has on the school</li><li>Maintain focus on the big picture.</li><li>If there are two or more underutilized, poorly maintained facilities in the same geographic neighborhood, it would make sense to consolidate to one well-maintained, and well-staffed building. Focus on improving poorly-rated facilities in struggling neighborhoods. Reduce bus transportation to distant schools.</li><li>The experiences of all families in the community matter. Remember, the school has a specific community it is tied to. If the school separates itself from the community, then there is no school and there is no community long term.</li><li>Keep an open mind for several conflicting/paradoxical issues.</li><li>This is politicking towards an answer, I struggle to see how it applies to my own city and school district. How can we utilize the lessons in the readings to inform our work?</li><li>Neighborhood centric schools backed by local community not the city at large.</li><li>I'd have to read the book.</li><li>There is no one size fits all answers to multi layered situations</li><li>I think it’s easy to look at the success of the midtown schools but there are major discrepancies from those schools to the other schools. I think it’s important for all schools to be successful. Not just close the underperforming ones and fill up the successful ones with more students.</li><li>Closing schools is a complicated issue and we need feedback from parents before doing so</li><li>Genuinely involve the community. Not Mind Trust not Stand for Children not these school reformers who don't have skin in the game. Chicago's union is the only reason why the vultures we have here haven't picked apart that district school by school.</li><li>BTW why doesn't the district ever take time to applaud and appreciate the neighborhood schools that are successful? 109 on the west side gets zero accolades. They should be a model of success, not continually ignored. I digress.</li><li>Great idea to replicate successful schools! Did you know XX (name removed to maintain privacy) has a plan to keep replicating the CFI schools? I think it was her dissertation when getting her doctorate. Don’t mess with what’s working! Most families love the K8 model and are embracing the same IPS schools they used to flee. If a family wants a middle school, you have them. But most don’t. Please don’t spend our money reconfiguring schools people like. Most families will leave IPS at the middle school level just as many leave for high school. Put really good administrators in our high schools instead of promoting and shuffling around failed former leaders.</li><li>We need to listen to the research.</li><li>Better understand the impact of closing a school, or making a neighborhood school into a choice school and removing any kind of proximity</li><li>Are you serious?</li><li>Having not read the book I don't have an opinion on how lessons in her book can inform IPS school board's work. I'm sure there are useful lessons in there. However, as it's from one perspective, students and families, it likely doesn't give lessons regarding others costs and benefits of closing the schools. Is there another book that can be read to create a broader understanding of the closings?</li><li>Look to IPS’s successes - innovation schools for example - and do more of what’s working vs throwing things at a wall to see what sticks (which risks gutting enrollment)</li><li>How is this a survey?</li><li>Create more opportunities to create community through the schools and replicate what works. The greatest driver of a student's success is parental involvement and being surrounded by other successful students.</li><li>Schools are communities with identities and opinions that should not be overlooked in this process. If the district says choice schools are the trend with increasing numbers, then families are looking to move out of boundary schools and, presumably, out of the district if their voice in their community isn't listened to. Throughout the year, I received numerous texts and emails and phone calls with information. This process has not been communicated the same. The email I got about the last meeting occurred the day of the meeting, after it began. The email I got about this survey with the link was received on the day it was due in the afternoon. Parents have been communicating on school discussion boards that they have been looking for the link and not finding it.</li><li>Again, to take abbreviated descriptions on much deeper thoughts and practices could be dangerous, equating in further inequities. Overall, I do believe, we need to serve the needs of the community and listen to the community when making decisions about school consolidations, closures, and new openings.</li><li>I think we need to make sure the community understands why the decisions are being made. While it's easy to say "let's let everyone pick their school" the practicality is not so easy. It could mean that families like mine, who live next door to a school, are unable to attend that school. It could mean that some kids have long or unreasonable bus rides. And no matter what some kids will get a worse deal than others.</li><li>We must continue to acknowledge that our large district represents a huge diversity of races, cultures, socioeconomic statuses, and resources. Solutions that work for one group my not always work for another.</li><li>Consider more than just the bottom line or test scores as a determining factor</li><li>We need to embrace unique learning models</li><li>I don’t know since I can’t tell what exactly was the suggested pre-read?</li><li>Let's think carefully about what we mean when we say a school is "failing" and lets prioritize the voices of the people who know the school best, the teachers, administrators and especially the local community and parents when deciding what's best for a school.</li><li>I think it’s important to recognize that school is an anchor for a community but the school is also not going to fix all the community problems. Partnerships with organizations to help reinforce what goes on inside school walls are necessary in areas with low performing students. Parents are often not educated enough to help with the homework. These things can’t be left up to the teachers. Moving kids out of their neighborhood doesn’t help either because it makes transport more difficult and volunteer opportunities harder to fill.</li><li>Making sure all kids/schools have the same resources/training/materials is key.</li><li>Look more broadly at why the choice schools, which are mainly k-8, are successful. Parents choose to keep their kids there because of continuity of instruction. This can be replicated at neighborhood schools as well. Parents choose to keep their kids there because of extracurricular opportunities, which are often led by parents. Segmenting families into k-5 and 6-8 schools will limit these opportunities for parent involvement rather than increase it. Parents choose to keep their kids their because it keeps the entire family together. Many families are spread too thin already. Asking parents to divide attention between elementary and middle school events is unimaginable.</li><li>Not everything is racist</li><li>?</li><li>Understand that people feel very strongly about the schools their children attend.</li><li>Hard to say since this is only a brief summary of the book. Though one could suggest that it means to say that white folk should be less worried about attending a school that is their neighborhood school where people of color may attend, and that if their children are attending a monochromatic school they should recognize that as a betrayal of educating their children. Further, the school system should support local neighborhood schools and treat them the same as they would a magnet school that the white folk like.</li><li>Don't reconfigure schools that are working. You will only exacerbate the problem you are trying to solve. Why are we not talking about recreating working models in quadrants that are lacking? Many families choose neighborhood schools due to transportation issues. They can't come see their kids in an after-school activity if it means driving 30 minutes one way. Offer top quality in all neighborhoods.</li><li>We can make sure we are listening to all voices, not just the loudest or wealthiest, to assure that we are making equitable decisions for all students.</li><li>Continue working to keep schools alive.</li><li>We cannot approach this this a "single solution" mentality. The issues are complex and nuanced. What makes a "great school" can be defined differently by different stakeholders.</li><li>na</li><li>did not read</li><li>Do our best to keep schools open. But to bring programs that have succeeded, along with the wraparound social services families need, to them.</li><li>Not sure, it doesn't offer any solutions to the challenges we face</li><li>Be thoughtful and mindful of the impact of decisions to close school. Communicate transparently and proactively. Consider ways to maintain belonging and community.</li><li>Listen to one another. Give one another the benefit of the doubt. Acknowledge the tension that exists.</li><li>I do not feel qualified to answer questions about the review because I haven't read the book.</li><li>There are lots of factors that go into deciding a school and we should look at each carefully and make decisions on a school by school basis rather than using blanket solutions.</li><li>Mindfulness to the diversity within IPS</li><li>Again, in order to get the actual lessons, we would all have to read the whole book, not just a review. The review didn't really provide lessons. The main point present was that all families are invested in their children's education. We should definitely be striving to provide all children in the district with quality schools.</li><li>Duplicate successful school models within ips rather than change existing schools and take away grade levels. People desire schools close to their housing, rather than being bussed across town. Identify the most requested schools and replicate that same quality of instruction, with the existing schools supporting. Existing current teachers at the ‘successful’ schools can help staff, coteach or mentor teachers in the newly started schools. Specifically poll parents in areas that have strong consideration of being changed. Uprooting students across the district is not ideal and is disruptive.</li><li>Are you going back to a 100% neighborhood school model and getting rid of choice?</li><li>Even in lily white Kansas, parents spoke out against school corporation consolidation because they didn't want to lose their town school.</li><li>Be more inclusive in high performing schools</li><li>In lots of ways. But why would we?</li><li>Many of my points are above but asking the school communities of which grade reconfiguration would deeply impact would be step one. More buildings would be needed. More staff would be needed as many overlap in schools now and most importantly we’d lose the sense of community our school and others are built so highly on. This would be a costly error for the corporation and families within IPS.</li><li>In the book, Jitu Brown organized a hunger strike to save her Chicago neighborhood school from closing. IPS parents may do the same or similar to save our schools if needed. Our IPS school is incredibly important to our family and those of children and youth who attend.</li><li>You shouldn't. Keep your politics away from my children.</li><li>Find ways to engage more families in the conversations and solutions</li><li>All should think wisely about the choices made, who they will effect, and if the choices will truly get the outcome wanted.</li><li>We need to look beyond the numbers and learn more about the reality on the ground for families.</li><li>Maintain an awareness of peoples’ desire to appear as if social Justice is a priority to them, and make sure to centralize that over awareness of what leads to better lifelong outcomes. Make those adults feel social Justice-y, pretend not to be weirded out by the advocate for public school who is paying $12,000 per year for a tutor because they absolutely value public education’s benefits over real-world results….for those poor kids at least, and pretend like math and reading don’t matter much. When teaching children invaluable skills like conflict resolution, healthy communication, and math, make sure to centralize the adults’ need to feel as if they are advocating for justice so that they have the external motivation to actually give a s*** about the kids they’re serving.</li><li>Access more resources</li><li>Equity needs to remain a focus as we seek budget solutions.</li><li>Not clear</li><li>What are best practices. What keeps students and families in IPS? Not just the buildings, but the curriculum, community, and culture of the school. How do we replicate the best we have - CFI, Montessori, Classical, IB, curriculums in other schools.</li><li>I think general equality and race education</li><li>By listening to parents and students at individual schools.</li><li>Do what’s best for our kids stop discussing race</li><li>To make sure that is it not a blanket solution. Don't just listen to the parents at the choice schools. Listen to the voice from the schools that are struggling or on the list of potential closures. Do they want their schools to look like the lab and montessori offerings? We need to hear those voices.</li><li>NA</li><li>I think the question is how to maintain enrollment with private schools able to use public funds.</li><li>I think it presents, with tremendous depth, the notion that continuous tinkering of the lives of students and families to better force Education to be a savior of a complex system of structural oppression.</li><li>If we close schools, we need to make very thoughtful choices about which ones are closed and which are kept. And understand that there will be people who are upset in every scenario.</li><li>Teach anti racism</li><li>To make sure the topics get done and not just talked about.</li><li>Truly listen to your parents and let them voice their concerns but also educate them on the why's and how's of the future of the district.</li><li>Consideration must also be made for how changes will affect the current families attending the schools that are under review for reconfiguration.</li><li>Allow history and context to play a role in our decision-making, in addition to data.</li><li>I appreciate the end of the article: "Ewing offers no blanket statements" on how to proceed because each situation is different. Closing schools in IPS's case, sadly, makes sense. Reconfiguring all schools to K-5 &amp; 6-8 schools, however, does not. That's a blanket statement that doesn't fit every school in every neighborhood and every situation.</li><li>I was not present for Meeting 6 and have not yet read this link -but will!</li><li>It is important to keep in mind that there is no one size fits all approach.</li><li>I think one needs to read more than one article before making informed decisions.</li><li>That the system is broken, the answers are complex, but community schools matter far more than is taken into account, and should be provided, and this provide, adequate resources to build success.</li><li>Listen to the families of the schools you manage</li><li>Cultural sensitivity &amp; historical significance must be considered - it's more important to meet the needs of students and families than to keep far-removed budget hawks happy.</li><li>We need to look at more than just data but also understand the cultural and community impact of these spaces.</li><li>See above</li><li>Need to ensure equal opportunity for all student in IPS instead of contractions of options only to those with wealth</li><li>Work with the communities around underperforming schools to see what the community wants and take that into consideration</li><li>Please consider leaving the k-8 schools</li><li>Increase our awareness of and attention to the experiences of and impacts upon historically powerless groups.</li><li>Require diversity</li><li>Look more closely at the failing schools and listen to the ideas, wants, and solutions proposed by the families who make up that population.</li><li>We can offer grace to those trying to make the best, albeit imperfect decisions, about how our Public Education System works.</li><li>By identifying under-resourced schools in the system.</li><li>Closing public schools is complicated and should be carefully, thoughtfully, and slowly perhaps.</li><li>I applaud IPS for giving us background and context. Systematic racism is but one of the causes of IPS' failure to run a successful school system. For example, I'm trying to give input and you've managed to over complicate this survey.</li><li>Schools aren’t merely the sum total of their test scores and attendance levels; they’re spaces that facilitate an under- standing of a shared past and culture." Changing and closing schools as the best option is truly sad. If as a society we can't find a better way to fix, or as XX (name removed to maintain privacy) teaches treat the groundwater of a broken or struggling public school system, any band-aid solution is just treating the symptoms.</li><li>It’s not saying close schools. Improve the ones that need to be improved. Make it more equitable across the board.</li><li>We should be mindful when closing schools to make sure that we do it in a way that continues a framework of empowering the families and community in the area in which the school is closed.</li><li>Think more deeply about the importance of schools as a neighborhood anchor.</li><li>It was just a book review so there’s not a lot of substance in it. I do think that it is important to remember that schools hold meaning in a community.</li><li>I believe it is the messaging that we send out. We need to closing some buildings to be fiscally responsible and to allow the district to put funds in the places that make the most difference. I love Daniel Webster because of the staff, students, and families. If I was told that this building would not be used anymore and it was being consolidated with another building in the neighborhood or close to the neighborhood, which would then allow the students I love, to be offered more programs, more supportive staff and possibly allow more transportation to be provided so if they have to move (with in some limits) they could remain at the school, I would gladly give up my building for the kids.</li><li>Take a realistic view of how power and politics has intersected how IPS are set up and the inequalities that presently exist and actively address it in every community. Many IPS schools are presently segregated continually perpetuating the systemic issues.</li><li>I’m not sure what lessons in readings you are talking about.</li><li>Be intentional in restructuring and take parents opinions into account before deciding what is best for others.</li><li>See above.</li><li>I don't really know for sure, other than there are no blanket solutions to the problems we face.</li><li>Stop closing public schools simply because it is difficult to keep them open. Not everything is driven by economic factors, where will the students go when these schools are closed? What benefits is derived from marginalizing an entire section of society? Maybe start thinking about these things before we close schools.</li><li>I think it is good to examine the experience of those who have gone through something similar to help us think about things we may not be aware of</li><li>Observe other IPS schools have happy parents and happy children.</li><li>We should be mindful of the ways in which these school merges/closings, etc., will impact students of color. While I would love for there to be more diversity in the school my sons attend, I believe that it is important that rigor and quality are not sacrificed in the name of inclusivity.</li><li>Misjudgments that were made about families and communities should not be repeated.</li><li>It's clear to me that the reading suggests that schools should be a place that validated ALL families experiences and nurturing our young people. However, the proposed seismic changes to K-8 structure seems to be opposite of the reading. What if a school is serving its students really well? What if a school really needs a continuous structure from K-8 to help those students who are gifted and/or twice exceptional? I find Sidener Academy a place that really represents the best of IPS, in terms of equity, representation, cohesiveness, sense of community, and a sense of family.</li><li>Keep in mind that “there are no blanket solutions.”</li><li>Closing schools in certain communities will lead to a negative impact for families</li><li>Schools are more than numbers.</li><li>There was not enough context and detail to determine .</li><li>Listen to the community members, not just those without an actual stake in the outcome</li><li>We need to study as to why some of the schools have lower enrollment and why aren't they performing. Obviously the 6-8 Middle Schools did not work before 15 years ago, because went back to a K-8 models.</li><li>We need to have clear paths forward for families &amp; staff members at the affected schools. This will make transitions smoother &amp; less jarring for all involved. It is also important to make sure their voices and concerns are truly heard during the decision making process.</li><li>Diversifying our schools and spreading out our resources evenly will help make our schools more of a community.</li><li>Taking measures like grade reallocation may allow greater utilization without the need to shutter schools. This is also an important reminder that parents and stakeholders care about their schools even if they are unable to attend public meetings.</li><li>Recognizing the culture to create a greater empathy and building family relationships</li><li>Creating successful schools in neighborhoods that are underserved will take more than just slapping a CFI or Butler name on the building. And will need to involve stakeholders beyond IPS. Who is going to make students, families and staff feel safe being in/going to and from those buildings after the school day ends? Are the college schools of ed going to recruit ed majors from the neighborhood so there are local role models and staff families see at the grocery store? Point being, one institution alone can’t address the real issue of equity.</li><li>No clue</li><li>l need to review more than one perspective?</li><li>Please do not close any IPS schools. This will be damaging to families and our communities, especially in economically disadvantaged neighborhoods. For those of us who have more economic privilege, it has already made us wonder if we will start sending our children to private schools or move out of the IPS school district (like so many educated professionals). Yet, for now, IPS schools are working well for us. Please invest more resources into the schools and staff, the buses and bus drivers, and the whole K-12 school system. Rather than selectively amputating parts that you believe are underperforming, trying to understand why, and offer supports and resources, is a better solution.</li><li>We would like to see more data to support the closings of schools.</li><li>We need better resources and opportunities for all students-- not just a select group</li><li>I do not believe you need to read articles like this to determine what is right for all kids, no matter what their race is. Why do you even mention race, why not make a rule of not mentioning the color of someone's skin whatsoever, unless it is a criminal or lost child issue???? </li></ul>

I love getting rid of priority zones, which have made schools like IPS 84 essentially a free private school for the most affluent in our community while neighborhood schools nearby struggle.</li><li>Yes</li><li>Some parts- yes</li><li>more or less</li><li>Equity for sure should be paramount.</li><li>Fairly well</li><li>Are you kidding - no one really understands what you have in these slides, most leadership has likely already made a decision as to what you are going to do, as per usual IPS does what they want, not what strong evidence suggests</li><li>No</li><li>Yes.</li><li>Yes</li><li>I think so. I like the idea about world language becoming part of the core subjects.</li><li>No, this seems to be changing for changing sake. These kids are coming out of the hardest two years of schooling and now you want to shuffle the deck again.</li><li>No</li><li>I believe this actually starts on slide 5, I would say yes.</li><li>I think for the most part. You have an extremely hard job of finding a good balance with success and failures with IPS</li><li>This seems to paint choice schools as the enemy. They are really just neighborhood schools with a smaller geographic boundary. </li><li>I can’t find these slides. I found your strategic plan. Sounds good, but until you have strong principals in our schools, these are just words.</li><li>I am not able to find the referred to slides. Where are they?</li><li>A tough question. It certainly doesn’t grasp most of what I’m looking for in my kid’s education. I think the negative image of choice school is on the district.</li><li>I may be missing something but I've reviewed slides 10-17 from Meeting 6 and am puzzled about what exactly the key components are that this question refers to. I'm making an educated guess that the key components are; Facilities, Enrollment and Choice, Finances, and Student Experience. I'll answer this and the following question assuming that I'm correct.</li><li>Yes, the key components capture what we value but miss the most important value for him. The greatest value IPS can provide my son is to educate him better than my wife and I can.</li><li>One would hope.</li><li>Yes, I think so.</li><li>Yes</li><li>Yes</li><li>Personally, I value what is most beneficial to my family. To date, I have taken steps to identify the type of schooling best suited for my kids. I struggle to understand how the proposed changes will positively benefit my kids.</li><li>Yes.</li><li>It doesn't capture the "educational theory" given to parents by the district years ago when it moved away from having larger schools and defined middle schools in order to have the smaller, K-8 in one building model. The information seems to discount the "what works" model for the students who are succeeding. This doesn't look at youth success; it looks at costs of education. Also, the 446 Million dollar figure should be better explained. Is this for all buildings, including the vacant ones or only the ones in use?</li><li>In all honesty, I cannot answer this question, based upon the slides that you are asking me to view. This has me questioning how this questionnaire will lead to productive conversation. This process of slides, which are very difficult to find and interpret, greatly limits the number of honest responses provided. In turn, this process is extremely inequitable, in itself.</li><li>No</li><li>We're missing a big piece of this puzzle. By offering "choice" schools, it immediately implies that others are not "choice". The Choice school concept immediately starts to slot kids into buckets where families who put more time/resources/etc into their children are more likely to take the time to opt into a program and who do not, are less likely to. That's not to say that all families on those programs have done this, but it immediately starts to skew the numbers in the same way that separating schools by location ends up skewing them by who choose to live in that area.</li><li>Yes</li><li>Yes, making access to choice schools more equitable is important</li><li>Totally agree on replicating models of successful schools--all IPS schools should be strong.</li><li>Yes</li><li>Nominally</li><li>I think it captures much of the most important things.</li><li>Yes</li><li>I believe so.</li><li>It's clear that the community wants more of what choice schools offer. Increasing seats and opportunity, while better utilizing buildings is a good goal. Do not trade in what works (k-8) to create something that doesn't fit the current mold. That would be like offering inquiry in only one subject, Montessori without the assistants, or Spanish Immersion to Spanish speaking students.</li><li>The enrichment portion seems to highlight a failure of neighborhood schools and should not punish choice schools. They are high performing for many reasons!</li><li>No.</li><li>?</li><li>I supposed, but different families have different values. For some it is small class size, for some it is special ed, for some it is location, for some it is sports, for some it is the enrichment that is offered.</li><li>Who is we? It captures my feeling that IPS is not funded enough, that the funding is not being shared equitably, and that choice schools should not be prioritized over neighborhood schools.</li><li>I don't see anything in there about the importance of low student:teacher ratios and how that key relationship is key to student success. It is not just about the number of enrichment offerings or the utilization score of the building. It is about the actual relationships formed and how certain models are doing that better than others.</li><li>yes</li><li>Yes</li><li>Yes</li><li>na</li><li>Yes</li><li>yes</li><li>I'm not sure I see key components to grow and succeed on slides 10-17…I see data on IPS operations. Children need love, stability, wonder, and support. In strong families much of that comes from family life. In other families that has to come from community institutions like schools.</li><li>I guess, it seems to be telling a story of closing schools to free up cashflow</li><li>I think so.</li><li>I read the values on page 5. Slides 10-17 showed data. But the values on slide 5 -Yes I agree with them.</li><li>In general, I agree with these key components.</li><li>Yes</li><li>Yes</li><li>Yes, I think it is a reflection of our values.</li><li>Yes</li><li>I am not at all sure that I found the slides that you are referencing but not saying where they are. Possibly?</li><li>Underutilized buildings are an issue, there are funding issues</li><li>No</li><li>no</li><li>Sure but not sacrificing schools that are thriving.</li><li>Yes</li><li>We certainly value the community and education in our child's small and nurturing school, but most of these slides are focused on finances. Despite our child's classroom globe still showing the USSR, we love our school even with budget constraints, and we do not want his school closing or him moving to a huge middle school in three years with all new teachers and staff who do not know him and his particular needs. It's really an incredible loss to radically change schools across the district by separating elementary and middle schools in the name of finances when your own slides admit that the combined elementary and middle schools are doing well and should be replicated. You cannot say you want to replicate the schools that are doing well and then dismantle them. These schools doing well is in large part because of the continuity, community and nurturing they receive for many years and especially through the very difficult middle school years.</li><li>No.</li><li>Yes I think so</li><li>Are we looking at what is most developmentally appropriate for students at variance ages? Have we included anything about how children best learn at different stages?</li><li>Mostly</li><li>Yes</li><li>I don’t think it captures evidence-based approaches to maintenance of healthy long term relationships as much as it captures political points</li><li>yes</li><li>All the responses in the slides are one-sided were their any opposing views in any of the responses?</li><li>Which slides are you referencing? Why aren’t they attached or linked here?</li><li>Unsure</li><li>No</li><li>Yes</li><li>No.</li><li>Yes</li><li>Yes I believe so</li><li>Yes</li><li>Yes</li><li>I don’t think so.</li><li>I believe in a since that what we are trying to get done is definitely talked about and explained very well with what the schools need and where we need to be at to get there.</li><li>As a parent I value community and the support my son gets from his pre-k through 8th school. We are a true representation of what this city looks like and wish the district would stop choking out montessori because they don't understand the philosophy or the hard work ethic of our students under the care of both their teachers and I.A's.</li><li>I believe so. The choice schools are wonderful and I wish you would replicate the experience for more students by utilizing the neighborhood schools to create those same options for everyone. I agree with changing the proximity zones. We are a proud to have our children attending IPS.</li><li>However, we DO NOT believe you should fix what isn't broken, i.e., removing a successful K-8 model from a school; particularly a school the follows the Montessori method of education.</li><li>Yes</li><li>It seems so. I appreciate the out of the box thinking IPS is engaging in to support students of color. It is critical. I am SO glad IPS is considering eliminating the proximity rule. As someone who has worked in magnet programs, it is obscene how the younger grades are almost exclusively white which is not even close to a true reflection of the students of IPS.</li><li>It does seem to capture district values. I do agree with eliminating proximity priority and with expanding high-quality programs to the east, south and west sides of the city.</li><li>The health (or unhealth) of our communities is still simply understated in this picture. Neighborhood schools are a lifeline for some of the most vulnerable schools. They often end up with the students who have the most need, not only due to parents not enrolling them in choice programs, but in systemic inequity and in the fact that many times choice school will remove “behavior” children who live out of boundary. Rather than find a way to meet their needs, they pass them back to the neighborhood schools.</li><li>I think these items cover the bulk of what we value.</li><li>Possibly. I think redistributing students to underutilized buildings would help. I think increasing choice options to the east and south sides would work. Your biggest issue is that you are in bed with the Mind Trust. Not everyone wants to attend an experimental neighborhood school. When you turn over a neighborhood school to an unproven operator, you don't give families much choice. It's stay there and hope it works (it usually doesn't) or you try to get a spot at a choice school, or you go to a charter school. You don't even mention stopping or slowing the innovation/charter model, which suggests to me that you are not serious about creating equity for our students and that you are fine with continuing to use our black and brown students as guinea pigs for the Mind Trust.</li><li>Please send me the slides</li><li>There a few items that could be included</li><li>Yes</li><li>Yes</li><li>The stakeholder feedback is on target.</li><li>Somewhat</li><li>Yes</li><li>Yes</li><li>Sure</li><li>I’m not convinced.</li><li>Depends on which "we" the question refers to…</li><li>Who is "we"? What I most value is a good school, near my home, with reliable transportation options. You've given me one out of three (a good school). I do agree with the question re: why can't every school be as good as a choice school?</li><li>Children, our students, value a safe place, kindness and love, food and beautiful materials. They deserve the best we can give everyday. They deserve the truth about history. Acceptance, inclusion, love, and peace. It seems that the individual teachers were not considered for their individual contributions of time, money, and emotional and logistical support of students and their families.</li><li>For the most part</li><li>I don't understand who "we" is. This question confuses me. I agree with some of points.</li><li>I felt it covered a lot of the areas I value. I also want to draw attention to the language used when discussing choice vs neighborhood school. I have heard in multiple meetings talk of "replicating the choice school experience" for all students and schools. I want to replicate the resources, the funding, the enrollment and marketing push that are focused on the choice schools for our neighborhood schools, but do not want the "choice school experience". I want it to be recognized that our neighborhood school was our family choice. A valuable choice to seek out the experience my children will only get at George Julian #57, our neighborhood school. There is value in going to school in the community where you live. I don't want that erased.</li><li>I think so.</li><li>Yes</li><li>Yes</li><li>If you truly wanted to make things equitable they would not be equal. You need to give children who are starting behind more resources to catch up. Put the money to the teachers and the enrichment programs. Keeping the smaller programs open allow for more kids to have access to after school programs whether it’s a sports team or Lego club.</li><li>Yes, I think making sure the whole child is seen and treated fairly with more equal opportunities would.</li><li>The k-8 model is highly effective. I truly believe the path to this key goal of the project- "Supports that see every child as a whole child with a full range of human needs" is much more attainable in small middle schools. I have experience or witnessed many of the other approaches over the years as a student and parent. I went to Shortridge when it was just 7-8 and remember trying 6-12 there as well. There were too many students and the community was not as strong as k-8. Reviewing the spreadsheet for many of the current k-6 schools it seems clear that most have the space to add 7-8. If the middle schools are failing we should expand the k-8 model to all students. The middle school at</li><li>91 is diverse and produces capable, confident students who excel in schools as big as</li><li>North Central and as small as Riverside. I agree that proximity preferences should be eliminated and the zone concept implemented. The zone will help with transportation and the proximity preference elimination help with increasing access for students across the district. I also think that we should strongly consider a replication specifically of Montessori across the district. You know the history of the philosophy so it makes sense that it would be effective in a district like ours-especially in k-4. Also, I have witnessed our middle school and elementary have so many opportunities mostly driven by our athletic director (also MS teacher-best teacher ever XX (name removed to maintain privacy)) and parents. If we dedicate funds to support positions that can focus on extracurricular as a primary role, the opportunity expansion will be easier to achieve in the k-8 model. Perhaps the money is best spent to support small enrollment schools in communities that need more school based support. Add middle school to these buildings, hire support staff in the form of teacher's assistants and extracurricular/sport managers, partner with community supports and work to make the budget meet the needs.</li><li>Yes</li><li>No</li><li>I think so.</li><li>Yes</li><li>As a parent, no.</li><li>I believe it does.</li><li>I am assuming that you are talking about the slides from June-23-2022 meeting. Slides 10-15 seems to focus on finances without any particular information as to how much in the red the district will be (slide 14 had a projection with $0 line but no additional numbers to orient viewers to how much in the red it will be if no actions are taken). Also, it's talking about how much costs more per pupil in a smaller/under utilized school setting but it's not clear how the utilization of the properties can be increased without enrolling more students which also seems to increase cost. However, this cost wasn't discussed even though the impression I am getting is that the district needs to make this change to keep it afloat based on the information presented</li><li>It captures what the district has stated they value.</li><li>I think we need to do a better job of advocating for our children's cultures and beliefs and have that reflected in our curriculum and teaching.</li><li>Yes</li><li>No mention of students with disabilities - including self-contained programs</li><li>Primarily. Equity should be first and foremost.</li><li>We are trying to do what is best for the children, but I don't know if closing several schools is going to help.</li><li>Diversity and equality in schools is what we most value. If we make more choice schools available to families we would give more opportunities for diversity within these schools.</li><li>This emerging picture from the stakeholders is beginning to frame what we most value. Good work!</li><li>agree</li><li>I'm not sure the slides lined up.</li><li>No</li><li>In theory but not practice. Data appears skewed and messaged. The cause and effect for slide 12 is closing public schools or converting to Charters under the guise of choice. Thousands of students have been disrupted and left with no choices. Also, percentages mask the numbers of students. Also, stability is a function of the students served vs students selected by more engaged parents.</li><li>There are no slides attached to this document, so I cannot comment on this.</li><li>could not access slides</li></ul>

Why are we not considering making all quality K-8 instead on the K-5 &amp; 6-8. I appreciate how in a K-8 school the older kids take ownership and become positive role models for the younger students."</li><li>I do have concerns about how many schools are under utilized, but I question if the financial assessment is correct. Can the full value of empty buildings be obtained if the law requires charters be allowed to purchase/lease the building for $1? We opted for choice, not neighborhood, because the choice school is walkable from our house and the neighborhood school is not. Proximity and community were important to us when making this decision. We felt like the neighborhood school was a good school, but would prefer to be less than a mile away from school. That being said, I do agree with removing the proximity priority because of the larger issues at stake. It may be time to assign schools based on address, like in other districts in Marion County. If the desire is to replicate successful programs, how will IPS ensure that more teachers are trained appropriately? Given the teacher shortage, this seems like a hefty, possibly impossible, undertaking. </li><li>"Inviting outdoor spaces" are nice but would fall very low on my list of priorities for a successful school. Focus on academics. Focus on talented and engaging teachers and team members. Focus on enrichment programs including athletics and arts. Physical safety, including healthy meals, is important. The playground equipment does not need to be equal or the same at every facility-- outdoor spaces cannot be the same at every facility-- geography doesn't allow for it and it is not the highest priority for learning. Better neighborhood schools, your shared article states people value their neighborhood school … what's working doesn't have to change</li><li>Discussions around removing boundaries and/or sibling preference might short term increase attendance for those of color. However this will also create a situation long term for current families and the community. If children within a mile of a school cannot attend the desired school, families will have limited options which will more than likely lead to moving to a different school district or attend non IPS schools. Both of which on a large scale will negatively impact IPS and it’s financial stability and most definitely impact the sustainability of the once sought after school. For each “committee reaction” I strongly suggest the committee walk through both the positive and negative impacts of these ideas. From BOTH the lens of community members and non community members of said higher demand choice schools.</li><li>Nothing</li><li>I don’t want separate middle schools</li><li>I am concerned with doing away with sibling preference as it would be hard to have kids at different schools.</li><li>As I have talked to other educators, nothing can good can come for consolidating more adolescents of varying abilities into one place. It will be a lost year or two at the very least. I agree about expanding the curriculum of the high performing school but trying to reengineer how our community organizes itself is silly. K-8 neighborhood centric schools for deep community involvement</li><li>The main issue I have is removing proximity completely from schools. My family has been in an IPS Choice school (#91) that did not have proximity and it was very difficult to be connected with families and kids because they were from all over the city. It also made it difficult for many kids to be involved in after school activities. There was also a lot of turn over of kids and that made it very hard for continuity and stability and friendships. We are now at a CFI and are getting the type of neighborhood school experience that most people move out to the suburbs for. Our kids have friends in the neighborhood. Can safely get to and from school while getting some activity (biking or walking). As a side note: we were in Chicago Public Schools magnet school program. While we loved the montessori &amp; IB school, the 1.5 hrs in the car for my kids was not ideal. That was a key reason my family decided to move to Indianapolis. We were looking for a more manageable city that we could raise our family in. We are big supporters of public school and are proud to be part of IPS!</li><li>I understand that this is a very difficult balance to support all kids but we also have to acknowledge and not reverse the re-urbanization trends that have been vital to keeping and even bringing money and tax dollars to this city and others throughout the country. I believe most of the young families in our area, which is predominantly white and higher income welcome racial diversity as well as diversity of thought, ethnicity, beliefs, what love looks like and in fact are searching it out. But putting our kids in an environment where they can learn and have great outcomes is perhaps even more important.</li><li>A solution could be perhaps be to replicate more successful programs and put them in more areas. Could this be a better approach versus trying to push people further from their closest schools that happen to be choice magnets? Or perhaps widening the radius so there’s a bit more chance for socio-economic, racial and ethnic diversity.</li><li>I worry that if you make this change, you’ll push more high-income families to private or parochial schools or unfortunately out to the burbs because they won’t be willing to have their kids bused to schools further away and to significantly lower performing schools. Do we need to find another reason to send more families out to the burbs when the pandemic is already creating a flight to suburban areas? This is a very real risk and in 5-10 years could mean a very significant loss of tax dollars for urban areas and school districts. Or, would we rather find ways to make more schools even better and grow IPS and it’s success versus shrink the district? I also challenge whether this is as much a diversity issue than a socioeconomic issue. I looked at a lot of past data published by IPS and other school districts and would love to hear more about the challenges outside of school choice that are resulting in lower overall performance? Are there other programs that are needed beyond school choice? Finally, I do very much agree with the idea of creating grade 6-8 schools. This would free up more spots for more elementary classes and would also create a more natural path for continuing on into IPS high schools. For example, an IB middle school at Broad Ripple HS could feed into Short Ridges HS. For what it’s worth, this survey was hard to navigate to and requires a lot of effort. If you are truly looking for responses, I would look to enhance your digital experience and make it easier to find. Respectfully, An IPS Choice School Parent"</li><li>I would not move from the K-8 model. Myself and my husband were both students in the middle school model and both hide not have good experiences. It was extremely difficult to go from one model of teaching to another. It was easier to get bored and ignored. I think being able to stay in the same school from K-8 would greatly help the child’s confidence and focus in their educational needs.</li><li>Instead of trying to change choice schools, try to improve and promote neighborhood schools</li><li>Go with what is working! Great idea. Taking what is working and jacking with it is what has been done so much in the past. Don’t do it!</li><li>Where are the slides?</li><li>all 4 CFIs are effectively on a straight line (Central Ave) through some of the cities more affluent neighborhoods. Why not put another on the West Side or East side? I’m pleased my kids go to a great school in the neighborhood I live in. Removing sibling priority and proximity would vastly complicate my life for purposes that I don’t fully comprehend.</li><li>Again, and I am sometimes easily confused, I'm not sure what this question is about that I would change. I'll forge ahead despite my misunderstanding. My son is extremely blessed to be at the Montessori option school 91. We were very happy with his progress in 1st grade, the leadership of the school and subsequent culture. If his experience is significantly and detrimentally changed, we'll leave the district. To me, an influx of new students older than 1st grade will be bad for existing students. In my opinion, significantly higher enrollment at #91 will be detrimental to learning. Denying siblings from automatically attending the same schools breaks up the family. I cannot overstate how poor of a decision this would be. If my son cannot continue to attend #91 because we don't live in a new geographic zone will cause us to move out of district. Eliminating proximity priority reduces community building which is contrary to IPS value of building communities. I feel this is roughly my thoughts on the solutions provided by Rebuilding Stronger Reorganization Plan Committee on 6/23/22.</li><li>Practice what you preach. IPs has/had an invaluable opportunity to provide an excellent education for its students by allowing Purdue poly to occupy the old broad ripple high school. Instead, In what amounted to a toddler saying that “if I can’t have it, no one can</li><li>IPs chooses to continue mediocrity and the building to stand empty. I do not think the board truly has the best I retests if it’s students at heart when it makes such decisions and thus it’s hard for me to make the switch to IPS since I constantly question its competency.</li><li>There are a lot of very good points within the mentioned slides. However, it left me wondering what would go into determining the "higher-performing" tier of schools and what the long-term plan would be for the replication of models.</li><li>Choices are important, but creating a system where choice is unnecessary should be the value. The process in inequitable and it should be the goal to abolish it in favor for a robust system for providing quality education without the necessity for parental intervention.</li><li>How are students doing with the current model of classroom space versus how they did in the past when there were designated middle schools? It appears as though the district is willing to risk student success of its middle schoolers to cover years of fiscal mismanagement toward building care. And for my second point, is there a tiered building repair plan option that could continue with the K-8 model that was put forth from the district as a best practice solution?</li><li>There needs to be serious reconsideration of the plan to eliminate the k-8 schools. To me, it feels as though IPS has made a decision to “increase the size” of the successful elementary schools, which means they need to get rid of the middle school students in order to add classes to preexisting programs. as a result of this being the most economical way of doing this, caveats have been added that this will increase opportunities for middle school students. However, what you are not addressing is the fact that what makes those programs so successful is that the programs are long term (over 8 years) and allows for a better transitional approach into high school (safe, small, environment, where staff already know the students), allowing for the most difficult time period of a child’s development to be supported well! Increasing the size of the k-5 school decreases the impact of those schools and their programs, while cutting the longevity of the program in half. This, then becomes inequitable and takes a research based, successful program and reduces the success and benefits of the program.</li><li>In addition, the complexities of the questionnaire are great, including doing a prereading assignment that is an abbreviated op-Ed on a book for which we still don’t know fully what the author’s points includes. The reality is this process makes the feedback inequitable!</li><li>I believe in the k-8 model. For me, it’s the small grade sizes with intimate teacherstudent relationships building on the previous grades not to mention the importance in these grades of transitioning our Montessori children from manipulatives (particularly in math) to more text-based approaches. To me bigger middle schools do not equal better. Far from it. They might be able to offer more enrichment options but at what expense? I fear too many kids will fall through the cracks - ironically those most at-risk which is what this plan is trying to solve. My Mom and sister-in-law were teachers and administrators in a private K-8 school and can tell you that it is much easier to support every child and ensure no one falls through the cracks when you have less children per grade level.</li><li>Getting ride of k-8 schools is a mistake. My children’s school fosters a strong community among the students and provides plenty of opportunity to the middle schoolers. The point of the choice schools is for parents to choose the best program for their students. Forcing kids to go to a “traditional” middle school will increase bullying and lower student involvement and quite frankly send a lot of those families out of district to private or charter programs that have a smaller feel. There are some great options on the table for district but this one is not it.</li><li>Keep K-8 its a critical element to minimizing the disturbances that begin with prepubescent students in large groups in middle school ages.</li><li>I would not change the structure of the high performing schools before attempting to recreate in a different location to see if the “build it and they will Come” philosophy works of if the high performance is actually do to the boundaries and mostly neighborhood kids filling seats leading to higher volunteer participation and more educated parents which help students at home.</li><li>I don’t know</li><li>Parents want the choice schools as they currently exist. And by parents, I mean those that currently have students inside of them, as well as parents that want their family to be a part of them. I am not interested in any stand alone IPS middle school and believe this is the case for many of us in k-8 schools.</li><li>Have a bigger input from school social worker/family liaison to understand the mobility problem at neighborhood schools. A lot of family/community dynamic not taken into consideration here!!!!!</li><li>Not move 6-8 to a middle school and do not remove the proximity boundary.</li><li>?</li><li>Understand that for many, having a small school is a really big plus, and that many families enrolled in a school BECAUSE it is K-8. In fact, we really liked our neighborhood school, but wanted a K-8 school, and that's not what our neighborhood school could offer. Make certain to provide more information on what the K-8 models do for students. Just creating more elementary space is NOT a reason to change the model. We have been such a big proponent of our school in part because of its middle school program, which is entered seamlessly from the elementary.</li><li>Increase funding, make funding equitable among all the schools, apply the same approach that the CFI schools receive to all schools and remove the magnet school process. Provide the funding to all schools to provide before and after care for those parents who need extra support during non-school hours due to their commitments to their jobs.</li><li>Include data on teacher:student ratio and how that impacts student success - both in achievement and social-emotional gains. These solutions focus too much on building scores.</li><li>unsure</li><li>Concerns about the consequences of long commutes/bus rides for children leaving neighborhood schools to attend choice schools. Concerns about schools having the funding, training, resources to meet the needs of a ALL students attending a school.</li><li>Do not switch to all K-5 and 6-8 schools</li><li>Keeping K-8 schools. IPS students have been through a lot in the past few years and need stability. I reject the idea that moving them to 6-8 schools would be beneficial.</li><li>Changing back to a k-5 model is a HUGE step backwards in our district. We have tried that for many years. In fact i attended middle school at shortridge and without a doubt the k-8 model is safer, more developmentally appropriate, and more aligned with what kids and families need.</li><li>nothing</li><li>It may well be necessary to close some schools to stay in the black. But if we want to address decreasing enrolling and low performance in neighborhood schools we should be looking at new methods like "Teach to One" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teach_to_One</li><li>Nothing about the values. I think those are the right leading thoughts - Equity, Accessibility - every child has what it takes to succeed. However, I disagree with some of the proposed solutions like eliminating the k-8 option.</li><li>I think one value that is missing is the need for stable and strong neighborhood communities too. Strong neighborhood communities help create strong schools and vice versa. America is not an easy country in which to raise a family and having strong neighborhood connections that can carpool, watch each others' kids, etc., especially for those of us with no family in town, is important. This is what largely turned us off from Sidener. We were told by several families there that their kids have their neighborhood friends and then their school friends. If you don't live in a cul-de-sac, etc., building those neighborhood friendships outside of school is difficult. We've built most of our friendships through school. The separation also decreases opportunities to carpool to school and school activities, etc. I hope the Zones will help address this, but without knowing how large those zones will be, it is concerning.</li><li>I would change some of the suggested solutions, as I believe some solutions will be more harmful than helpful to the student body and IPS community.</li><li>I’m concerned that the added value of K-8 in certain successful programs will get lost</li><li>I would definitely get someone who has some idea about writing surveys to design all future surveys. And when you have concrete options to choose from, send out a survey with those options.</li><li>It would be better to see a school by school breakdown of utilization rates, grouping whole areas isn't helpful.</li><li>High performance and extracurricular opportunities</li><li>How is a small school defined?</li><li>Grade reconfiguration for sure</li><li>Redistribution" of programs and grade levels, combined with eliminating sibling priority in a system that wants to go all in to "choice" programs, creates significant potential for turnover and chaos across the district. We need to think carefully about implementation and keep in mind that numbers don't always tell the full story.</li><li>What's best for the schools of this district is not making giant middle schools and tearing apart the combined elementary and middle schools that are doing well. Most of the current stand alone middle schools in the district have D and F ratings from the Indiana Department of Education while many to most of the combined elementary and middle school buildings have A-C ratings. You say you want to replicate the k-8/2-8 magnet schools that are working but then say you will make middle schools separate. This means you are actually replicating the failing or close to failing middle schools instead of the schools that are thriving. Additionally, the charter and private schools located within the district that are also doing well are primarily K-8. Looking on the IDOE website at neighboring middle schools in the townships, it is clear the stand alone middle schools struggle compared with the elementary schools that feed into them.</li><li>I would not reconfigure the schools of IPS into separate elementary and middle schools. I agree with getting rid of proximity priority, having enrollment zones, and looking at better building usage for those that are less than 50% full, but I am adamantly against the proposed changes to middle schools. The combined elementary and middle schools in IPS are what make them desirable. They are why we want to keep our children in IPS schools so they can be with the same peers and school staff from elementary through middle school. I want all children in the district to be in schools where their IEPs and unique needs are respected from year to year and children build bonds with fellow students and staff.</li><li>I would make the focus of our SCHOOLS about TEACHING our children and NOT about YOUR POLITICS.</li><li>Included in seeing the whole child, we need to meet emotional needs especially after COVID.</li><li>Do we have any information or data on what is the best developmentally appropriate practices for the variances ages of our students that we are using in the process? It needs to be included so the district can made informed decisions based on meeting the developmental needs of students.</li><li>I do not think the sibling policy should change. Families would end up with children at several different locations which would create a childcare/transportation issue.</li><li>Nothing</li><li>Bureaucratic processes that enable egotism and displays of social Justice theater over student math and reading performance. Well….for those other kids. Because I’m guessing your kids have a private tutor</li><li>increasing size of schools is not a great idea or merging. IPS did this with high schools and now schools that were once succeeding are failing and students that are academically minded are now leaving. Fix problematic schools first without merging</li><li>We need to keep K-8 schools.</li><li>Why aren't "choice" options put in neighborhood schools? K-8 works, and keeping students together helps build retention and matriculation. If you change the Curriculum in schools that are working, more people will leave the district. Change comes from building on strengths, change weaknesses instead.</li><li>Nothing at all is said about innovation schools. I picked an innovation school for my family because their communication and care for my family was so different than traditional IPS schools. I mean look at Emma Donnan's website and branding compared to the DISASTER that is the IPS website. They also text and email us frequently. So much happier at this school because they care about us. So much better than both Skillen and Brandes</li><li>I would not get rid of the k-8 models. We need to keep these in place to facilitate growth.</li><li>All of it, stop focusing on race and focus on educating our children</li><li>NA</li><li>I would make education much more broad than the school day! I would heavily invest in growing strong, high quality Afterschool/out-of-school ecosystems available to all students in the district. I would change nothing to the way schools and currently run. IPS is full of amazing schools and amazing, talented teachers.</li><li>I would change the approach to making a stringing school. I thing more things can be done and I think that we have to make sacrifices to make it happen.</li><li>PLEASE do not remove the K-8 model at school 91 - or other schools where it is successfully working. That would be detrimental to so many students in the long run.</li><li>Ensure stability and consistency for those schools where the current model is working.</li><li>Existing K-8 choice programs should be permitted to remain as such. Choice schools are all already K-8 and have proven success. If we are moving to a model of doing all choice enrollment, we should be replicating all aspects of successful programs--which means K8 schools.</li><li>I have a concern/question about the data on slide 16 regarding the average enrichment classes offered at different configurations. According to this chart, the K-8 schools offered more enrichment programs on average than the 7-8 schools. This is one (of many!) reasons that I believe keeping the K-8 model is better that returning to the failed model of separate middle schools. It also directly conflicts with the one of the justifications for shifting to 6th-8th grade schools. The proposal states that switching to large middle schools would provide more enrichment opportunities but this data does not support this.</li><li>Inequity exists at all levels of educational institution. If we truly want to see equity provided to our students the. We have to walk the walk and not just talk the talk. Many ips classified staff are people (esp women) of color, who are grossly underpaid when looking at a living wage. Yet our administrative costs and salaries continue to rise. It is not only demoralizing and not fiscally conservative to pay administrators often more than twice what teachers make and 3 times was classified staff make, but it in turn hurts out students. Many of these same staff have children and grandchildren in ips schools, yet have to have at least two jobs to make ends meet. This leaves them drained and exhausted both at work and with raising their children. Teachers point to parents as the problem, and parents point to teachers as the problem, when really everyone is just doing their best to survive at this point. But until we take it seriously that administrators (many of whom are quite men) are simply not worth 2 or 3 people, and even out the inequity in our district, we will never truly be able to achieve equity for our students.</li><li>I think some where to show community involvement/impact might be important especially when looking at closures.</li><li>I would not get rid of the K-8 model. I have lived in Indianapolis for most of my life and attended IPS schools - including neighborhood and magnet schools. While I myself did not attend a K-8 model, I wish that more of that configuration existed during my time as an IPS student. The students that I have seen attend these schools are more confident, more engaged in their school, and have a sense of community. The fact that you all are trying to say getting rid of 6-8 grades in the current K-8 schools is to free up choice school seats is ridiculous. There are neighborhood schools that are K-8, and getting rid of this configuration would destabilize those schools. This is a crisis of your own making. You all have prioritized the northside for too long and catered to white affluent families for too long. Yes, replicate choice schools in other parts of Indianapolis, if you choose. That act, in and of itself, opens up seats for K-5 graders at these schools. Stop letting neighborhood schools "fail" so that you can justify turning them over to the Mind Trust graduates and start investing in these schools. That opens seats. As for the 6-8 model creating more opportunities, it doesn't. K-8 schools allow more students to make varsity sports teams and other extracurriculars when they don't have to try to beat out hundreds of other students.</li><li>See above</li><li>Like more data on the current different types of education models choice schools/etc showing where student are attending from density map. Showing success a factors for each type as this can show how equable these programs availability are. Also, would like a map of the state of building and the cost to get them to good status by area. Also on slide 10 why is the quad with the highest utilization result in the highest cost per potential student?</li><li>I think it was good</li><li>Leave the k-8 schools the same</li><li>I am curious how the restructured/consolidated system would support the special needs and services that are more apparent in smaller neighborhood-specific schools.</li><li>I do not want schools restructured from their current levels</li><li>I’m not sure</li><li>I am anxious about the decision to prescribe grade divisions across the board. (K-5: 6-8) I am unsure if these divisions should be applied across the board and at every IPS school.</li><li>To maintain the K-8 model that has been effectual and beneficial to ALL families.</li><li>We most value K-8 schools and teachers that are well compensated.</li><li>See above.</li><li>The assumptions that "doing nothing" means we have to change schools that are working. Is there really no other way to raise funds if that is the priority? If students aren't going to neighborhood schools where are they attending, and why? How does covid impact attendance changes? Is there a conflict of interest with the charter/privatized schools connected to IPS? How will closing schools affect the neighborhoods, businesses, safety, convenience of our students?</li><li>We need to keep the schools the same. We’ve tried separating K-5/6-8 before &amp; it did not work. There’s so much research showing that K-8 is the best for children on so many levels. Keep proximity preference in tact.</li><li>It leaves out the importance of stability. IPS and the new school board fails to recognize the way that continued drastic changes can affect children’s ability to learn and grow. Strong progressive change when something isn’t working in our society is a great thing and something we don’t see enough of in this country! However, it must be effective change. Sometimes it feels like our children at IPS are guinea pigs in an experiment that no one is entirely sure what the outcome will be. It also leaves out the importance of the student/teacher relationship. The bigger our schools get, the more our children become numbers. The successful programs are that way not necessarily solely because of their label or focus (Montessori, Reggio, IB, etc) but because there is an inherent focus on responsiveness to the students and relationship building. The bigger the schools and the classrooms, the less likely teachers (to no fault of their own) will be able to build the kind of relationships that foster love and inherently encourage creative and critical thinking.</li><li>I would add that changes need to be made so that district policies are reflective of the scientific evidence and best practices.The district must start implementing best practices - such as later start times for teens - and avoid implementing new changes that are known to be inconsistent with scientific evidence on learning - such as going to a k-5 &amp; 6-9 FAILED e periment. I don't know a single person who would support throwing all the 6-8th graders in school together that is a TERRIBLE idea. What are we stabilizing by forcing to go through such a major transition (leaving their elementary school behind) at such a precarious point in their lives. Honestly, I think that this is just an obvious way to save $$$ by sacrificing those kids. If anything, make all the schools K-8. Also, why are we throwing so much money into outside sources when funding us low. Cut all the unproven "innovation" schools and require them to meet the same requirements as other schools in the district. If so many schools are underutilized, why are we allowing tiny schools to open? Keep IPS money in IPS.</li><li>Looking at the disparities between neighborhood and choice schools, what steps did the district take to support neighborhood schools to close those gaps? I would like to see a focus on supporting the neighborhood schools with enrollment and increase in programming and extra curriculars. Investment in the student experience at these schools would be multiplied by the unique value in the neighborhood school and their communities. I have heard a lot of talk about authentically engaging families and communities, creating a community. I think the district has overlooked and undervalued the strength they could pull from the neighborhood schools who already have a foundation of community built in. They could use that foundation to make huge impacts for all students.</li><li>I think consideration of the needs students have outside of academics is really important.</li><li>NA</li><li>Nothing at this time</li><li>Look at the amount of money we spend on testing. It is a WASTE of money and time. Not to mention how this further separates children. You take away valuable time and resources to give the test and stop teaching. Look at any data from any school in the fall and you will see huge growth. Then look at spring. Little growth. Why? Because we do not teach in the spring, we test. As a past resource teacher I had to give multiple small group testing sessions which meant all the groups that had MANDATORY minutes in their IEPs for support went unmet because I was required to test. Then I watched my kids with special needs break down emotionally because the standardized testing was a ridiculous requirement.</li><li>It sounds like potentially reshuffling all schools, which is alarming to me. I would leave the successful schools as models (but definitely change priorities to allow equal access) and model new schools after these successful schools.</li><li>The k-8 model is highly effective. I truly believe the path to this key goal of the project- "Supports that see every child as a whole child with a full range of human needs" is much more attainable in small middle schools. I have experience or witnessed many of the other approaches over the years as a student and parent. I went to Shortridge when it was just 7-8 and remember trying 6-12 there as well. There were too many students and the community was not as strong as k-8. Reviewing the spreadsheet for many of the current k-6 schools it seems clear that most have the space to add 7-8. If the middle schools are failing we should expand the k-8 model to all students. The middle school at 91 is diverse and produces capable, confident students who excel in schools as big as North Central and as small as Riverside. I agree that proximity preferences should be eliminated and the zone concept implemented. The zone will help with transportation and the proximity preference elimination help with increasing access for students across the district. I also think that we should strongly consider a replication specifically of Montessori across the district. You know the history of the philosophy so it makes sense that it would be effective in a district like ours-especially in k-4. Also, I have witnessed our middle school and elementary have so many opportunities mostly driven by our athletic director (also MS teacher-best teacher ever XX (name removed to maintain privacy)) and parents. If we dedicate funds to support positions that can focus on extracurricular as a primary role, the opportunity expansion will be easier to achieve in the k-8 model. Perhaps the money is best spent to support small enrollment schools in communities that need more school based support. Add middle school to these buildings, hire support staff in the form of teacher's assistants and extracurricular/sport managers, partner with community supports and work to make the budget meet the needs.</li><li>Not sure</li><li>Larger schools do not facilitate better learning environment. Change the proposal to close current k-8 schools.</li><li>I don’t have anything to add there.</li><li>Not letting this happen. Leave Sidener alone.</li><li>Nothing in particular - just to ensure that the changes and consolidations are not made haphazardly. Certainly we want to save money and ensure that every child in the district is well cared for. We need to ensure that support systems are in place in the newly integrated schools such that EVERY student has an opportunity to experience success.</li><li>I would change it so the content is actually explaining the logic behind why the currently proposed changes are needed. Based on what's been shared, it seems like it's a money problem not a problem of equity, diversity, justice, honoring history and families</li><li>The facts are undeniable…the possible Solutions seem pre-determined</li><li>Need to keep in mind that larger class sizes aren't good for students either (putting a cap on class size if we're trying to minimize numbers of schools)</li><li>Our curriculum needs to be changed to reflect who are students are.</li><li>Sustain programs and grade configurations that are successful.</li><li>I would keep the option of K-8 schools for families.</li><li>As stated in the slides, more marketing needs to focus on what neighborhood schools have to offer -- less $ focused solely on choice schools. Also need to focus on the necessity of community/parent involvement to make neighborhood schools a choice destination. You want good schools -- that takes personal investment.</li><li>We should make more schools K-8 and bring the buildings up to the same standards that the township schools have.</li><li>I would make more choice schools. I think changing proximity requirements will help with diversity, but it's also nice when students can attend a school near their neighborhood. I think eliminating sibling preference will cause difficulties for families.</li><li>There needs to be a greater emphasis on culturally responsive structures and curriculum practices, particularly as it relates to linguistic justice and teaching of local history. With regards to linguistic justice (and academic excellence), we need to deepen our commitment to multilingual and culturally diverse education. To that end, I want to see a commitment to a Spanish Immersion program for middle and high school. IPS currently offers a Spanish immersion program at Theodore Potter for grades K-6, but there are no Spanish immersion options beyond 6th grade. Why? This needs to change. Additionally, I would like IPS to commit to teaching fact-based historical lessons related to Indiana and Indianapolis surrounding race and diversity. This includes the historical supremacy of the KKK in state politics and culture as well as the resistance to integration of Indianapolis schools.</li><li>consistent busing must be a consideration</li><li>I don't know; this question doesn't make sense based on the slides.</li><li>Keep families together in schools - should not do away with sibling preference</li><li>More input from actual educators.

<ul><li>I think Covid has made great public schools more difficult. Teachers, parents and students are worn out.</li><li>I definitely think the district should do all in its power to replicate the choice programs at all schools and create greater equity. My biggest personal concern is my child will somehow lose her seat at her school which has been an excellent fit for her the past three years. I am not sure about the idea that it may no longer be a K-8 school. The only way I think that could work is if you maintain the model well within the 6-8 program. We have the capacity to leave the district if it is no longer meeting our child’s needs so the focus should be on those that do not.</li><li>Again, not sure where link is. Is this survey for everyone?</li><li>How far kids near schools will have to travel if they have paid more to be near for home</li><li>Worries- methods of Montessori, community, and teachers who KNOW my child will be lost and I’ll be stuck in a big system where my child will be LOST!</li><li>Getting rid of the k-8 model. I really hope IPS does not do this.</li><li>I have worries about changing the K-8 model at my kids’ schools. I love that their school buildings house students through 8th grade and they do not switch until high school. It also makes for a stronger school community.</li><li>Concern about our 3rd grader not getting to stay in her current K-8 school through middle school. Concern that Middle Schools will be put in higher crime areas or taking our child away from her home school/neighborhood. Currently we can walk to our home school for elementary and eventually middle school. If the middle school is far away how will we continue this? There has been a huge bus shortage, how is IPS looking to solve that issue?</li><li>If you move from the K-8 model to a K-5 and a 6-8 model, please be sure to offer multiple middle schools with the International Baccalaureate curriculum. We chose an IB school for our children thinking that they would have an IB curriculum for K-8. It's not fair to remove that opportunity from them due to reorganization, especially because there is a high school with IB curriculum already. Please also consider that highperforming schools with poor facilities may need a facility upgrade or expansion, rather than closure or merging - don't abandon schools that are already working well, invest in them! I support elimination of the proximity priority but not elimination of sibling priority - that is critical to families making life work with multiple children, jobs, transportation issues, etc. I know hard choices must be made. Thank you for taking on this task with sensitivity and care.</li><li>If you switch to K-5 &amp; 6-8. Would my student I no a choice school continue with that style of teaching or would we have to do the lottery again!?</li><li>mentioned on previous slide</li><li>People invest in their communities and communities grow stronger through that investment. Local schools are a big part of successful communities. Children should be able to attend the school that is within walking distance from their home. Being close to school means that parents can also work outside of the home and still have confidence that their child is able to safely move back and forth to school. Children should not have to take a 50-60 minute bus ride to and from school each day. Distant bus transportation is also too expensive for districts to maintain. The focus should be on improving the school experience in the underserved neighborhoods rather than expecting these students to travel long distances. I think it makes sense to consolidate poorly maintained facilities into one (or more) well-maintained building that would serve a broader neighborhood. I do not think the school boundaries should be eliminated. It makes sense to learn from the programs that are working well and replicate these programs across the city. If the IB programs are working well at CFI 2, CFI 27, CFI 70, and CFI 84, then implement additional IB program(s) on the south, east, and west sides of the downtown area. If the Merle Sidener Gifted Program is working well for its students, then recreate a similar program on the south, east, or west side of the downtown area. I don't think equity means that all students should attend the same school. Equity means we should improve all open schools to a high level of achievement. Maybe some of the worst performing schools need to be closed and consolidated, but the schools that are performing well should remain intact.</li><li>Increasing seats without increasing staff and support in class room will not improve things as most choice schools are too full and have a great deal of students per class with IEPs that aren't getting fully met</li><li>Elimination of zones and boundaries will not sustain the community that your choice schools are in. the existing community should be of value to this committee and to IPS in addition to the other values mentioned. There can be multiple goals and objectives. One doesn’t need to overrun the other. Don’t overcorrect As a working parent, location of my child’s school as it relates to the location of our home is 100% important as well as having my children at the same school. Think through the impact of families 1 mile or less away who would be burdened with the denial of access to a choice school so close. What will happen to the community? Replicate choice schools in IPS areas that are needed - where the neighborhood school Is failing. Prioritize those.</li><li>Very concerned about changes to schools that are doing well. I would be disappointed if CFI 70 switches to k-5 because adding new middle schools sounds like a logistical disaster. Why mess with schools that are succeeding?</li><li>Please do not separate our k-8 school. I don’t want my kids in different buildings. Separate middle schools would be a disaster. All in one school is a huge draw to families and getting rid of that will send many parents to other townships or catholic schools.</li><li>Proximity to schools is an important element for convenience and community that I would like to see maintained. K-8 creates a sense of continuity and community that I would also like to see maintained.</li><li>I’m worried about school closings, enough crossing guards and moving away from the K8 school model</li><li>I am very concerned with doing away with sibling preference as it would be hard to have kids at different schools. I also am concerned with shifting the schools away from K-8 as this could impact the community developed within the school. I also think it is important for all kids in IPS to be in adequate buildings that provide a safe and happy environment to learn.</li><li>Grade reconfiguration and proximity zones would kill my neighborhood school. It would create an exodus of kids from high performing school, potential create more migration out of Indianapolis, and loosen the fabric of my own community. Why punish schools that are raising the bar for IPS?</li><li>Parents purchasing homes based on neighborhood school and walk ability</li><li>BIG worries about not having sibling preference. How would it be equitable to have families have to transport to/ attend events/ receive information from/ make calls to/ follow the rules of two separate schools? That seems like an incredible challenge. I would NOT be ok with my children going to two different schools. I already get so many e-mails I could never keep track of it all, and I have a desktop computer at home. Wondering how it will look to separate the middle schools. I think keeping kids with their peers throughout their school experience is important. Doing research for and figuring out which school my kid would work best at is not something I want to do 3 different times. Keeping their educational experience consistent and familiar, the learning styles and communities consistent and familiar, rather than necessitating a change to a completely different school for just 3 grades seems like a better idea. Let's create more choice schools. If my local school, 57, would have been a CFI school I would have been thrilled. Please please don't end sibling preference.</li><li>I am highly concerned with changing models that are/have/will continue to be very successful. In particular changing the k-8 model.</li><li>You cant replicate higher performing schools by increasing seats and eliminating K-8. That is not replicating, it is just trying something different. It will not create the same small community environment that currently exists at choice schools. Eliminating the K8 model and eliminating proximity will drive parents out of IPS.</li><li>How would the creation of neighborhood zones impact the cost of student transportation? We already have kindergarten students who are expected to walk nearly a mile to school while students who live a block from the school are bussed to choice programs. Would the shift to zones change this inequity?</li><li>Still can’t find slides. Families will flee IPS in droves if you change successful K-8 programs and try to get them to send their kids to middle schools. Don’t make the mistake of spending money on a program patents won’t support!</li><li>Not able to see slides.</li><li>It seems like the plan is to increase class sizes at currently higher performing schools. How is this a recipe for success. Eliminating proximity zoning on higher performing schools seems like a good way to drive parents to private schools. Why not more focus on changing programming in poorer performance schools? What is wrong with k-8 models?</li><li>I'll copy my answer from the previous question as I think it applies here. My son is extremely blessed to be at the Montessori option school 91. We were very happy with his progress in 1st grade, the leadership of the school and subsequent culture. If his experience is significantly and detrimentally changed, we'll leave the district. To me, an influx of new students older than 1st grade will be bad for existing students. In my opinion, significantly higher enrollment at #91 will be detrimental to learning. Denying siblings from automatically attending the same schools breaks up the family. I cannot overstate how poor of a decision this would be. If my son cannot continue to attend</li><li>91 because we don't live in a new geographic zone we will be forced to move out of district. Eliminating proximity priority reduces community building which is contrary to IPS value of building communities. I feel this is roughly my thoughts on the solutions provided by Rebuilding Stronger Reorganization Plan Committee on 6/23/22.</li><li>See previous answers re: Purdue poly and innovation schools. I worry about chopping up k-8 schools - where would these kids go to middle school to continue the (often) innovation curriculum. Getting rid of the proximity will also gut the neighborhood feel/community of many schools. Again, do what’s working. Create more innovation schools.</li><li>I would like to know about research about K-5/6-8 schools versus K-8 schools.</li><li>IPS has gone through big changes before, what makes this time different? I wonder if the IPS leadership will be permitted to make the hard decisions by the board and external influences that have made public education political?</li><li>I believe that all of the potential solutions are really strong. I have some wonderings about how the district could drive clarity about a family's options for schools. There is a lot of terminologies (choice, innovation, neighborhood, CFI, Butler Lab, ect) that seem to get muddled when communicating with families. For example, when on the IPS website Innovation Schools aren't listed anywhere under the "Enrollment &amp; Options" pages. You have to go to "Portfolio Management" under "Central Services" to find anything about Innovations and even then the information isn't about the schools, it is more so accountability steps.</li><li>I struggle to see how these changes benefit the choice schools. It seems they would be watered down and include families that never proactively opted for the culture at these schools. I feel even with more funding offered to those choice schools, it will diminish the education and experience for kids in choice schools.</li><li>Why split schools that work?</li><li>After the district proposed K-8 schools as the solution to address its struggling middle school issues, it appears the district is looking to adopt a class model that will not benefit its students in order to make up money from apparent fiscal mismanagement. Building solutions should be given within the model the district has said is best for youth. There's been no addressing how these widespread changes benefits the student's academics.</li><li>What information has been given to parents about whether they want a choice? When I toured the Butler Lab school, the staff talked about how they have to go out into the community and door to door ask families to enroll in their school, even though it's in their boundary. If the school experience for its community, not of a single family, is one where "choice" isn't taken advantage of by those in the streets around it, then creating widespread change without proof that choice is wanted or will be pursued is based on a falsehood.</li><li>Additionally, with the transportation issues as they were last year (my bus wouldn't do a pickup, only a drop off and there were many delays and even a few cancelations), families who need the closest option may not be inclined to go any distance.</li><li>Finally, the discussion on the parent boards is that there will be a fairly large exodus of families, who could afford private school or a different school in their community, but have chosen to go public over private, if the changes, as communicated, take place because these changes are in direct contrast to what they've been told is the most successful educational model…smaller and K-8.</li><li>I am greatly concerned that my children, who are part of a k-8 program will be cut short from the benefits of the program in which we chose to place our children. We have 4 Black children (ages 7, 10, 16 and 18). Our 16 and 18 year olds went to a traditional middle school in a district in which I teach. Middle school was most difficult for both of our older girls. Although they were academically prepared, as parents we feel the cost of their social-emotional well being was not worth the academic gains they made (even in a school where their teachers were my colleagues and they had added support from staff). As a result, we made the decision to send our younger children to our neighborhood school 91, with the intention of them being part of the school through 8th grade! School 91 has provided strong academic preparation equal to (if not better than) our older girls’ peers who attend school with them, while providing the safe, research based instruction we have grown to love.</li><li>We need to keep the K-8 model</li><li>Concerns of getting rid of the K-8 model: I assume IPS moved to the K-8 model for a reason. A quick look at the internet indicates that some studies came out in the early 2000’s that showed better outcomes for kids if they did not switch to middle school but continued in the same building. I have not see anything in the discussion that cites any studies on how it is working now that IPS has implemented it. My concern is that it IS working and that is why the choice schools are doing better. By removing an aspect of the model that is working, we may be making the choice schools worse without realizing it. I’m worried that by putting the kids back in the lottery for middle school, friendships are lost and the continuity of the school experience is disrupted. Once that occurs, I’m worried the district would lose families/kids to private or outside the district options since Middle School is hard enough without throwing other issues into the mix. There seems to be a sharp decline in the number of students in IPS high schools when compared to Elementary school enrollment. I’m worried this pattern would shift to Middle School as well Removal of the Proximity Boundaries. The slide indicates it increases seats, but it does not do that; those buildings are the same size no matter who you put in those seats. What it does is move to more of a pure lottery system. I think the district originally created the Choice schools to try to attract families who might otherwise leave the district or choose private schools. The system has been too successful and now those schools are difficult to get into. We need to keep in mind that if we move to a pure lottery system, we may reverse that trend. Removal of Sibling preference - This seems like it would put a huge strain on families.</li><li>Does the research support the idea of positive educational outcomes when schools are divided into K-5 and 6-8, or are we simply exploring this option as a means to opening more seats in choice schools? Will choice programs, such as Centers for Inquiry, Montessori, and Butler Lab, have respective middle schools with their specific pedagogy and will students automatically be granted enrollment into those middle schools from their K-5 school? If middle schools are pedagogy-specific, will students who have not attended elementary schools with those programs in place be able to enroll in the middle school program? For example, if there is a CFI-specific middle school, will a student who did not attend a CFI elementary be able to enroll in the CFI middle school? How will IPS uphold the instructional quality of schools with specific pedagogies if they are trying to rapidly expand the number of seats and, therefore, needing to add a large number of teachers to those schools?</li><li>1. Impact of reconfiguration and consolidation on class sizes. 2. Effect of elimination of proximity/sibling preference on existing choice students. Will students remain in choice programs or re-enter lottery? 3. Choice offerings for new 6-8 schools. Will students from K-5 choice program automatically go to 6-8 choice program? 4. Location of new 6-8 schools. 5. Availability of qualified/trained faculty and staff for duplicated choice schools, expanded K-5 choice schools, and/or new 6-8 choice schools. Are there enough teachers who have been trained for choice programs to teach in expanded choice schools? Will other teachers receive proper training to ensure quality of choice programs continues? Will faculty/staff of existing choice schools be “redistributed” or have choice to stay with current schools? Is there concern that significant changes will lead to loss of high quality faculty/staff or dilution of high quality programs?</li><li>I’m VERY concerned about the change to k-5 schools across the board. Having the choice schools include middle school is important. These programs should be replicated across the district. Removing 6-8 will not be in the best interest of many students. Instead of adding more space for students you are punishing those kids who are part of a tight school community and will lose that program now in middle school and end up in a learning environment that does not work for them. The traditional middle schools exist already. If I wanted that for my daughters I could choose that but I emphatically do not and chose their school with the intention of them staying through 8th grade. I would honesty have to reevaluate my choice to stay in the district if this changes. It is such a bad idea. It defeats the purpose of the choice schools.</li><li>I feel very strongly that successful K-8 models (e.g., Montessori, CFI) should not be disrupted and separated into separate elementary and middle schools. This would be the opposite of the stated goal of replicating successful models, and would instead be damaging a working part of the district.</li><li>I urge the adoption of the K-5, 6-8 grade groupings. I teach in a K-8 school, and it has NOT been good for the elementary students NOR the middle school students. I like the idea of enrollment zones, as so many of our students bounce around back and forth to different schools every time they have to move to a different house. This plan would reduce that, increasing enrollment stability. Yes, please consolidate schools so less funding goes to maintaining buildings and more is available for enrichment programs.</li><li>We specifically pursued Montessori and 91 through choice. We believe the community that 91 setups prior to 6-8 is essential in maintaining the best citizenship in that age group and would see sending 6-8 to large Middle Schools problematic. Westlane, Belzer, as examples.</li><li>I'm worried about the closing of neighborhood schools. Our neighborhood school at Garfield doubles as a community center and has a super positive impact on the community. It's suffered as the neighborhood has gentrified and parents have chosen to send their students to private/choice schools, but there is interest in keeping the neighborhood kids local.</li><li>I'm concerned about removing 6-8th from k-8 schools. Since it works, can we replicate other places? Also concerned about making sure art and music programming is included in every school and not cut!!!! It is vital to development.</li><li>I do not want to see the current CFI structure changed. It is fine if you want to add additional programming in other areas to try and serve more students. It is not fine to alter the current setup which is working without knowing if changing the demographics would provide an equally successful experience. Moving from k-8 to k-5 and 6-8 is also not a good solution. The k-8 buildings have a much better situation for middle school growth. They are well known to the entire staff by the time they hit those puberty years. Kids don’t slip through the cracks in a k-8 building as much as they would when they have a big change in 6th. I like the current setup and would definitely consider leaving the district if it was changed.</li><li>Eliminating k-8 schools. I prefer this model to eliminate transitions.</li><li>I struggle with having middle schools. As someone who went to a k-8 school, I am glad I did not have that extra transition from elementary to middle school. The community of the k-8 almost seems worth the extras that are challenging to fund.</li><li>If you create more choice schools, what is the timeline be for teacher training and where will that funding come from? When IPS consolidated high schools, there was a lot of turmoil academically and socially. What approaches will you put in place to create community in that school rather than just moving students around? Will families and students currently at choice schools be grandfathered into their current school?</li><li>I am worried about reorganizing the grade level of schools. I LOVE having my middle schooler in a K-8 building and not in a stand alone middle school. I chose my school for that experience and love how it creates community. I have a seventh grader and would be heartbroken if these changes impacted their ability to finish middle school in their current school.</li><li>What quad would i live in? How are they split? Would each quad have a designated HS? Why are they choice if we move this way? 70 is in pretty bad shape- we have the smallest gym in IPS so would we be closed to remodel and our k-5 students merged at 84? Would BRip HS open as the CFI middle/HS option? Your bus shortage was atrocious this year how will you get kids to school when they don't live in walking distance? How will you train CFI/IB teachers to create more??!!!</li><li>If some of the best schools are K-8, why would you move 6-8 out? Why can't we work on underperforming schools and add resources without disrupting schools people are happy with? Why does everything have to be based in race?</li><li>Why would you move from K-8 to K-5 buildings when the k-8 buildings are the ones that are successful? It doesn't make any sense and I want the buildings that are current k-8 to stay that way.</li><li>This is not a valid form to solicit feedback</li><li>I have significant concerns about the grade configuration across the board. For high performing K-8 schools, part of the reason they are so high performing is the presence of a constant team approach to education through these years and stable peer group through a socially and developmentally challenging time of life. I think forcing these schools that are functioning well to split will be detrimental to the functioning at both age groups.For schools with alternative learning styles this is particularly important. My kids are at 81, a Montessori style school, and my 8th grader has benefitted from that style of learning throughout her childhood. Only having that experience until 5th grade then changing schools and teaching styles would not have prepared her as well for childhood. For high ability kids, having middle school in the same building allows for elementary teachers to keep kids challenged. For these reasons, I think there will be a lot less stability and retention at these high performing schools that are currently K-8 and while we will aim to stay within the IPS system others I'm sure will not. At our school, many parents stay at 91 specifically in order to get the Montessori middle school experience for their child, and this would be lost by this reconfiguration</li><li>That strong and successful K-8 schools will be dismantled so we can fit more elementary kids into those same buildings. So you aren't really expanding. You are pushing some kids out, kids who have an expectation of what their middle school experience will be, and comfort in that, to "expand" the choice programs. My rising fourth grader already is excited about the middle school teachers. There is a lack of recognition that maybe some of these schools, maybe MOST or ALL of these schools, are at least in part successful because they ARE successful AS K-8 schools. More focus should be on the equitability of getting into those schools in the first place. I do not disagree that proximity is an issue. I know a family with 3 kids that completely and utterly bought themselves into spots at CFI 2. Most people cannot buy a vacant lot downtown and build a house on it, because their kids are somehow more deserving than going through the lottery like everyone else. That's unfair. You should be looking at what other similar districts have done, and increase fairness in enrollment in the programs moving forward. NOT taking apart what is working.</li><li>Yes, expand/replicate the programs that attract folks to the CFI schools. Do not eliminate the K-8 system. Closing more schools means fewer neighborhood schools, and that is not what I have submitted earlier in this that is appropriate. Geographic zones will only encourage a more segregated school community. Eliminating proximity priority would encourage more diversity. Sibling preference elimination is not good however. It puts more burden on transportation and pollution thereof, more burden on parents for pick-up and drop-off and emotional strain on the students.</li><li>Cons: Reconfiguring K-8 to K-5 and 6-8 What research are you using to make this recommendation? I have only heard the financial argument that is based on old buildings and underutilized schools. I have yet to hear a compelling argument for reconfiguration that puts the student first - what research points to academic gains of the traditional MS model? What research points to the social-emotional gains of the traditional model? There is overwhelming research supporting the K-8 model for both achievement and social emotional gains. Reconfiguration will increase number of middle school kids in a classroom. Small sizes with intimate teacher relationships is what makes the K-8 model work. You think that increasing the number of students in MS will = more robust programming. It may mean a slight increase in enrichment offerings at the 6-8 level, but less meaningful interaction between students and teachers. Middle school kids need access to quality teachers in a supportive and intimate setting. It is not all about the number of offerings. You are proposing to increase the student: teacher ratio at a time in their life when young adolescents actually need decreased ratios. K-8 model also works because there are K-5 teachers in the building that know and can continue to provide consistency to the fragile 6-8 grade students. It is common for these teachers to team, collaborate, and share critical data with the 6-8 teachers in the building before the students head to MS. Our K-8 IPS models are literally the best option we have to compete with the private K-8 options in our neighborhoods. I was a MS teacher in a private K-8 building and know the benefits for students, families, and teachers of this model. This is why I chose IPS. It was different than what the districts were offering at the MS level. I purposefully moved into IPS to be able to register my 3 children in a K-8 model that works. If we dismantle the K-8 offerings, we will see the max exodus at 5th grade, further exacerbating the middle school exodus and funding issue you are trying to solve. Furthermore, some families will no longer choose IPS if aren't offering the unique K-8 model anymore. Why should they choose IPS if outlying districts are offering the same traditional model but providing them in better buildings with better funding? Simple answer - they won't. Last but not least, the impact this configuration will have on our dedicated and highly trained teachers and staff is not acceptable. Teachers who have been trained in our specific and unique choice offerings can not just be moved into traditional MS classrooms. They have dedicated their careers (often at a significant financial disadvantage) to the specific models they care deeply about in the small classroom settings they know work for all students but especially for at-risk students. Pros: Eliminate the proximity preference in the lottery. This has been a problem from the beginning, but sibling preference is important - can't expect families to separate. Move to zones for transportation could be good, but how would this impact our only high ability school that serves the entire district?</li><li>I appreciate expanding choice programs to areas of the city that have long gone without. Please put a choice program into School 57. Irvington would welcome such a program, after years of having to send our kids far away to get the programming we desire.</li><li>I'm very concerned about breaking up K-8 schools into an elementary and middle schools. The experience at CFI 70 is amazing directly because of the inter-mingling of students across ages. I have volunteered a lot at our school and to see 8th graders helping the younger children is amazing to see. It's addresses everything that was wrong with my own educational upbringing around those ages. I see our older kids be encouraging, compassionate, reassuring, helping stop fights and course-correct negative attitudes. I see the younger students looking up to them and replicating their kindness. Please, please do not take this away by breaking up K-8 schools.</li><li>I am concerned about eliminating sibling priority - families need to know they can send their children to the same school. That priority needs to remain in place to give schools and families stability.</li><li>Do not switch to all K-5 and 6-8 schools.</li><li>1. I think a top priority should be to keep families together (provided that is what the family wants). From an equity standpoint, I understand the move to remove the proximity preference but I believe it is important to keep the sibling priority. I am interested in more details on the proposed zones. Would each zone include elementary, middle school, and high school options? I don't think it is ideal for kids/families to have to travel far to get to school. As a family who has been planning for the last 5 years to send our kiddos to the school in our neighborhood for K-8, it is concerning to think about where the 6-8th students might be moved to. If your child is in a choice program currently will they be able to remain in the program for middle school (even if that is moved to a different building)? Likely these things are all in the process of being explored, I think it would be very helpful to have general timelines given of when these changes would be expected to start occurring.</li><li>I do not believe that eliminating K-8 programs is in children's best interests. If the goal is to replicate successful/desired programs (ex. the CFIs) which are K-8, why would you change what is working? Would families be forced to go through the Enroll Indy Lottery 3x instead of 2x (for K, 6th, and high school)? Will students in a certain magnet program for primary school be given lottery priority to attend the middle school with that same program? Otherwise, why would a family commit to a certain specialized program for primary school if they may not be able to continue it through middle school? Keeping K8 in one school is beneficial to both younger and older children alike in terms of opportunities for mentorship and peer support, plus it helps with the difficult middle school years to be in a comfortable environment. IPS previously eliminated separate middle schools; what is different now that it should be changed again? While I believe all students should have access to high-quality, free neighborhood schools, I also believe that eliminating proximity zones will make admission to desirable magnet programs more equitable. My child was lucky enough to receive a lottery spot at a magnet even though our family had no priorities, and I was told that she was one of only 3 children not in the "proximity" zone to get a spot. If the proximity zone is eliminated, admission will be more equitable. However, ideally, each neighborhood will have access to desirable programs so that children can attend schools near their homes and their families will not have to worry about long commute times to attend school. The International School is moving out of the former IPS school at 49th and Boulevard. There are no magnets in the Butler-Tarkington/Crown Hill neighborhood. Perhaps IPS could consider obtaining that facility to duplicate one of the magnets. Broad Ripple High School is also empty and if the concern is that there is more demand for magnet programs than available seats, why is that facility not being utilized to expand popular programs? I do hope that IPS does not consider removing sibling priority. It would be a hardship to families with multiple children if they ended up attending multiple schools across the district, balancing transportation/extracurriculars, etc.</li><li>Eliminating K-8 options. This concerns me. Students have been through so much at this point, they should be allowed to remain at their current school.</li><li>When you have magnet schools and montessori specifically, the students benefit from all of the students in the buildings not just in the grade. Montessori is not set up to split up this way and redo schools with a k-5 and 6-8 atmosphere. Montessori acts like a family where everyone works with one another from k-8 this split of the school would take that away from the kids and the montessori experience</li><li>My school is Montessori, a teaching method that doesn't just transition automatically to a traditional school. The 6-8 years are transition years to get kids ready. Eliminating the school as K-8 would make montessori impossible, unless there is a montessori 6-8 building. Otherwise the transition years would be 3,4,5th grades….leaving pure montessori for only the youngest kids. Beyond the grade reconfiguration, I have concerns about shifting to enrollment zones. What does that do for current students? Is it phased in or would I have to move schools if I'm not in the right zone? In my case, what if there isn't a montessori in my zone? If you don't have the same programs with the same performance in each zone you're going to end of penalizing or rewarding different neighborhoods…sort of the same problem we have today with proximity boundaries (I support eliminating those).</li><li>I wonder if any of the middle school options will be appealing to parents/students from the current K-8 Choice schools. Or will all those kids end up in township or private schools</li><li>Will switching to K-5/6-8 lead to an exodus from the district at 6th grade? Personally, I'm likely to stay at my kids current school through 8th grade before considering both inand out-of-district options for high school. If a grade level reconfiguration forced me to make an earlier choice, I would be looking at in- and out-of-district options earlier. I think this should be given careful thought. Also, middle school is hard time for students from a developmental perspective. Are student outcomes better for middle schooler in a 6-8 setting than in a K-8 setting? Retention of students? Retention of teachers? I assume research has been done regarding the success of one approach over other, but would want to understand this more.</li><li>I am concerned about the decision to do away with K-8 schools. One of the driving decisions for my wife and me in our school choice was finding a school that was k-8. We liked the stability it would provide for our daughter over a longer period of time. We liked the idea of a smaller "middle school" experience. We also really loved the Montessori model and were encouraged that could be continued until it was time for HS. Middle school is already a difficult time in a child's life. Adding multiple transitions, and changes in teaching methodology seems to add unnecessary strife. We will be very disappointed if this option for parents goes away. I would venture a guess (though I could be wrong) that many parents choosing the choice schools (CFI, Butler Lab, and Montessori) do so at least partly because of this stabilizing factor of staying in a school k-8.</li><li>I apologize for not having attended or viewed the sessions prior to meeting 6. But, from what I have heard in the review, I'm concerned we're perhaps not understanding what makes choice schools work. Is it the K-8 model, curriculum, smaller grade sizes, strong connection with the neighborhood, etc.? I want every IPS student to attend a strong, high-performing and nurturing school! My concern is if we don't understand what makes a school all these things, then we may be removing key ingredients.</li><li>Our community choose a school based on programming (Montessori, IB, etc.) not dismantling them to a traditional middle school is taking away the success that is proven. Is a consolidated MS being based on the programming? Won't it be more expensive to have Montessori, Reggio, IB, Traditional middle schools especially because the teachers need specific requirements.</li><li>I am extremely concerned about the potential of losing a sense of school community by moving away from a K-8 model. That model is very important to why we chose our school.</li><li>If replicating the success of choice schools is a goal, why eliminate the K-8 configuration? I maintain that a significant contributing factor of choice school success is the K-8 model. This model contributes to community building and gives students and families longer term stability. Instead of a K-5 and 6-8 model, replicate choice schools in other buildings. Consolidate some smaller neighborhood schools on the south, east, and west sides of the district and offer more choice schools there. Understanding this would take several years to implement, it seems a wiser approach than radically changing what does work well: K-8 choice schools. Offer more of them rather than changing the model. Also, one major issue for those of us who live outside downtown and the north side of the district is that the choice schools available are far away. For example, none are east of Keystone (except Sidener, which is only nominally east of Keystone and is on the far northern edge of the district).</li><li>I wonder where middle schools would be located and how big they would be. I wonder how far kids would have to travel to school when some schools are closed.</li><li>I am a past educator and middle school counselor. There is significant research proving the harms of school transitions - I believe minimizing school transitions is the best for students. I also believe a huge transition, like that IPS is planning, is incredibly risky and detrimental to its entire programming. As IPS has released these solutions, I have spoken to many families who said they will remove their children from the IPS middle school settings, if these changes are made. IPS will see a mass exodus of families, if their voices are not immediately heard.</li><li>Removing boundaries and transportation when transportation is such an issue now. My kids were late 3-5 days per week and we live 7 miles from school on the bus.</li><li>When programs have had success at a K-8 model, how do we know they would have success at a bigger K-5 or 6-8 model? Where will these extra teachers come from who are trained in specialized curriculum? What will happen to specialty schools such as Sidener or the Spanish immersion school? These are already small programs, best designed to be placed all in one building. I am not sure they can be replicated, they are already not full. Will these be exceptions to the reorganization? Sidener is only grades 2-8, the district probably cannot manage to support a 2-5 school for high ability students. I am also very concerned about how quickly you are going to implement these changes. In order to be successful, there needs to be a planning stage. If decisions are made towards the end of 2022, and entire schools are going to be restructured, then the fall of 2023 is mostly likely much too soon to implement the changes.</li><li>Changing school building at middles school changes the culture of a school and I think changes significantly the experience of students and families. I think it feels much less personal and less community-supporting than a k-8 experience.</li><li>Ips has some incredibly well-attended, sought after schools. I’m concerned about those being changed and students not being able to attend schools nearby their housing. Unfortunately parents in some areas have the means to provide private education and will likely choose that when nearby schools are no longer granted proximity priority. Private schools in those areas will see a huge increase and IPS will have less students/money. I also worry siblings will be placed at different schools and that is incredibly difficult on working parents trying to manage different drop offs/pick up and childcare.</li><li>What are you going to do about students with IEPs, many schools neighborhood, Charter, Innovation and choice treat kids with IEPs like something they need to run out of their building if they are "too hard” Some parents are very deliberate about their choice in school for their child. Are you also removing intensive needs classrooms from choice schools during the reorganization? Is the plan to move all the intensive needs classrooms and children with more substantial IEPs into 1 or 2 schools?</li><li>It is stupid to make big middle schools</li><li>Being led by knee jerk reactions. A lack of context. A lack of reflection.</li><li>My child is younger, but I have concerns about the grade reconfiguration and switching to K-6 with separate middle schools. I loved the fact that when we matched with our school, I knew my child could be there through 8th grade. What an excellent opportunity for school staff to really get to know her and for her to feel comfortable and at home in her school environment. Additionally, not having the school transition from elementary to middle school is a huge plus.</li><li>How grade reconfiguration would effect thriving K-8 schools without asking those communities. Change for the sake of change seems silly when sacrificing how a community operates and how students thrive.</li><li>I am worried that a move to split 6-8 out of existing K8 schools will create more turnover rather than less. Will families have to yet again go through a lottery process when they move to 6th grade? Will they be giving up the program and curriculum they chose when they transition to middle school? Why is the district looking to go back to a grade configuration that was a struggle in the past? Have we fully considered the impact of breaking up school communities? I'm also concerned that dropping sibling priority will lead families to leave the district. For many families it's crucial that their near-in-age siblings be in the same place for transportation and scheduling.</li><li>I worry about which schools you plan to close? Which programs will be replicated throughout the district and will they be replicated with authenticity to what has shown to work or in this separated elementary and middle school model that has not been tested and doesn't work with the current stand alone middle schools? Which of the kids will be left behind again or fall through the cracks in large middle schools? Do the teachers want to be moved to separate middle schools? Will we lose even more incredible teaching staff to neighboring districts because of these proposed changes? They were hired to teach in small, combined elementary and middle schools, not the sweeping proposed changes of this plan. I worry that IPS will be put into an even worse financial situation because families will flee IPS schools starting in 6th grade instead of 9th grade. I wonder why you didn't focus on building up and improving district high schools before dismantling the elementary/middle schools that are working? I wonder why high schools of the district are your model for stand alone middle schools rather than the k-8 and 2-8 schools that are working? Is this all financial as your first several slide show? What will you do when you hemorrhage students and the money they bring to the district for middle school instead of just high school? Do you want families to move their kids to private schools, charters and out of district for middle school?</li><li>Your continued focus on "equity" is misguided.</li><li>Would the middle schools align with the curriculum of the K-5 schools? What additional offerings could be available for enrichment in these solutions?</li><li>What has more success for students developmentally, a k-8 model or k-5 and 6-8 model? Does research back one model over the other? Are we looking at the environment in which children learn best?</li><li>What happens to children within a certain boundary? Do they lose their spot? Will children end up at different schools than siblings? Why can't we make Neighborhood schools into the high demand choice schools?</li><li>I feel that we've done this before (middle schools) and it was abandoned after it was determined that it didn't work. What's different this time? How will this concept work now when it didn't work before? I'm concerned about access to bus-service in these larger enrollment zones. I think choice program should target non-north side neighborhoods, specifically Irvington. I think a choice program at school 57 would be very welcome.</li><li>Strongly opposed to doing away with all K-8 schools. This model works extremely well for some of the choice schools and it would significantly disrupt those models to break up or limit the student population. I am particularly concerned about Sidener - it makes absolutely no sense to discontinue that school as a 2-8 school - the program is desperately needed for both 2-5 and 6-8 and there is a lot of value in keeping the kids together to grow and learn from each other and to ensure that kids that need to advance faster have access to higher grades without actually skipping up to that grade level for social/emotional reasons. Please do not disrupt the model at Sidener. We would likely look to leave the district if that program is discontinued or significantly altered.</li><li>The k-8 thing?</li><li>size of classrooms, not enough teachers and resources. Disrupting current middle school students</li><li>I do not like the idea of losing the K-8 model. This allows for fewer transitions and more opportunities for siblings to remain together for longer--easing the duties of parents for transportation needs. I don't know if I agree with the zones--the most privileged will remain. IPS should look to. I agree that the .5 proximity radius must go--but are zones creating as much of a problem?</li><li>How does this save money? Where would the middle schools be located? What will happen to Sidener and other gifted middle school kids?</li><li>I'm concerned about losing K-8 schools. The middle school model is not proven to work well.</li><li>I hate the idea of changing all schools to K-5 and 6-8. Doesn't work well with IB and Montessori curriculums. 2 of our strongest ones. I am watching the proceedings. The group that you have running these and funding the board is connected to enhancing charter schools- The Mind Trust. Instead of looking at all data, ideas, and best practices, they are very slanted towards charter schools only. People will leave if you get rid of some of the curriculum you have now.</li><li>If 6-8 is put into a separate building, will the CFI teaching philosophy/model stay or go to a general middle school set up? This is the same for those in Butler lab and Montessori schools. If a middle school is created, how much will it cost to bring transportation back given the likelihood of kids will not be able to walk to school anymore?</li><li>I want to keep sending my kids to Emma Donnan. Idk if I can if you take away our bus.</li><li>That things changes are pushed by a political reason and not for our Children's best interest. This is being don’t in secret and without parent support</li><li>If your child is in a choice school and the grades are separated into k-5 and 6-8, will the child remain in the choice program? I have a 7th grader at 70. If middle school is split off, will he remain in an IB program? What are the proposed enrollment zones? How far will kids have to travel to school? We currently walk to school, which is one reason we chose the school.</li><li>You more concerned about appearance focusing on core issues</li><li>my worries are about changing the structure from k-8. Middle school is awful for many people. I see the K-8 as eliminating some of the issues that come with moving that age group for 3 years. 3 very hard developmental years for many kids. A decrease in bullying and a sense of community with the middle grades is what I have noticed at my daughters school (Cold Spring). the lottery is also the most stressful thing as a parent/ You hear of the "good schools" and worry for much about what school you kid will get but if you are a rich Meridian Kessler family you always end up with a seat at 84 or a lab school. Would love to see that go away.</li><li>Yes, I have a lot of questions about how this transition to middle school will occur. It was not successful at the last attempt when IPS tried to implement this years ago. As an educator I have strong feelings that moving away from a k-8 platform is not the way to go. If we already have children slipping through the cracks in a smaller school, with smaller class sizes, moving to a separate middle school situation will only exacerbate the problem. There are many benefits to a k-8 building. It truly creates a more family centered, community based school that allows for more parent support and involvement. It allows the staff to really get to know our child on a deeper level. They learn about their best learning style and any unique adaptations that they may need. It allows our children to grow and mature at a slower pace. It also allows them to take a leadership role when they get into the older MYP years. The relationships that are fostered over a course of 9 years is truly unique and we are luckily that we have the ability to allow these to grow. When I was working in HSE as a 4th grade teacher I saw my students struggle immensely with the transitions to intermediate and middle school. Many were shuttled around, separated from their classmates and then wished “good luck”. Watching families go through these HUGE transitions ever 2-3 years just felt so unnecessary. These young kids were forced to start over, establish relationships with brand new teachers/resource staff/friends only to move on again in 2-3 years. I guess my main concern is that my children may lose their IB curriculum by moving to a middle school? I would assume that you would group all of the CFI’s together so that they can continue the IB curriculum. We do not receive bussing since we walk to school? It seems like this will be a very costly move for IPS because they will have to provide more transportation. Also, many of the MYP students walk their younger siblings to and from school on a daily basis to help 2 full time working families. This is another aspect to consider. As a teacher, I see more negative consequences than positive benefits to forcing our children to leave their beloved schools and start at a new middle school. I do know that if you go this route you will lose a lot of very involved families in the district. (There has already been talk on this). I do also know that more families will decide to explore private/charter routes. There’s just too much of a risk with not knowing what IPS will do next. I appreciate the opportunity to express our thoughts and concerns on this matter! Please feel free to reach out. Thanks</li><li>I am concerned about moving away from K-8. Many families value this model because of the community it creates and the stability it provides children.</li><li>Worried about the disruption of changing K-8 schools to K-5, concerned that eliminating K-8 will decrease IPS enrollment and push families to Township and/or private schools.</li><li>That you will close Sidener Academy without a viable solution for high ability students.</li><li>Sidener Academy has done a great with meeting the State's standards while still having both elementary and middle school age students together. What model are they using? How can we incorporate that into other schools?</li><li>More harm done to students from all of the tinkering in structure/pedagogical shifts/etc. All that transition is traumatic to kids. Those are my worries and questions.</li><li>I worry about the school closure decisions. I live the idea of enroll zones.</li><li>Do not split the schools. What about the small schools that can’t support a stand alone school like Sidener? Why are you having all these meetings about this but not involving parents or the PTO?</li><li>No worries</li><li>Switching from the K-8 model would be a huge factor in us leaving IPS. I know we are not alone in thinking that sending our kids to a random IPS middle school will not happen. You should send out one question-“If we switch to this model will you leave IPS once your child enters middle school?” and see what the response is. I think the district is underestimating the negative effect this will have on the district.</li><li>Pulling my son from his school to a new one with no regard for his community and the one that has been a safe space since kindergarten. Many parents want safe spaces for their emerging teens. Not new unknowns</li><li>We DO NOT believe you should fix what isn't broken, i.e., removing a successful K-8 model from a school. Our family has personally experienced how smoothly the K-8 model works. Montessori education does NOT stop at grade 5. It continues by giving the middle school student the understanding of oneself in wider frames of reference and provides a context for practical application of academics. The older students work with the younger students, while continuing to have a middle school experience at the same time. Our oldest is currently a rising senior with honors and I fully believe that is thanks to the solid foundation he received by attending School 91 through 8th grade. I wish I had been given such an opportunity when I was a middle school student. It is no secret that middle school is a challenging time, and giving students the opportunity to grow in a middle school within the supportive school environment they have grown up knowing is tremendous. It helped our oldest son transition easily to high school. I wish I could adequately express the diverse, loving, and peaceful community our school has. I want my younger children to experience graduating as 8th graders from this school as well. Our second son suffers from generalized anxiety disorder (resulting from the pandemic) and as a result we homeschooled this past year as he has been learning coping strategies. Thanks to therapy, medication, and the amazing support of our school, he is excited to try resuming school as a 6th grade student at School 91 this fall. A big part of what has put his mind at ease is knowing that he can resume classes with his friends and then they can move onto middle school - at School 91 - together. It is a rite of passage for the students there. Especially after what the students have endured these past few years, I find it saddening that you are considering such a drastic change that could negatively impact the students. Sending him to a larger middle school is not what we anticipated and cannot fathom how that will be good for him or others. PLEASE DO NOT LET THIS PART OF THE PLAN CONTINUE.</li><li>I am incredibly worried about the break-up of K-8 schools in to K-5s and 6-8s. Please, please heed the research showing that: "K-8 schools, or “elemiddles” as they’re sometimes called, say they promote strong relationships between not only teachers and students but also teachers and parents and offer stability to young teens during a tumultuous time in their lives. They argue that early adolescence — a period marked by more rapid physical and cognitive development than any stage other than the first two years of life — is a terrible time to transition to a new school. " (from https://www.kqed.org/mindshift/58310/k-8-or-middle-school-what-works-for-earlyadolescents-depends-on-manyfactors#:~:text=Those%20who%20argue%20for%20a,than%20their%20middle%20schoo l%20peers.) My question is: If the district is looking at WHAT WORKS - and wanting to replicate, grow, build on that; the vast majority of highest performing elementary schools are K-8s. As a parent who has spent my whole career in education, most recently as a high school principal, I chose an elementary school within IPS in LARGE part because it was a K-8. I only selected K-8s in my Enroll Indy options for my daughter. Society is making young teenager years so challenging, and we are just at the beginning of seeing the impact of social media, technology, and having lived through a pandemic. I am also curious how splitting to a K-5, 6-8 model would impact those schools that already have fully built-out K-8 models. Would there be individual 5-8s that follow the same models as their respective K-5s? If not, what 6-8 model would IPS base the middle schools on as there are not currently proven schools with that model in the district? In the various circles that I run in, there is SIGNIFICANT support for so many of the districts initiatives and efforts to "rebuild stronger", but this one is causing significant anxiety, grief, anger, confusion. Please consider swiftly removing this item from the Rebuilding Stronger list of recommendations.</li><li>I worry greatly about the impact the change in school grade levels would have on existing K-8 programs that are high functioning. We, and our kids, love the K-8 model, and to the best of my knowledge, it creates the highest possible density. As a choice school parent, some of these changes make me worry that the best parts of our experience with IPS will change, and will make it less desirable.</li><li>Making all programs K-5 and 6-8. This reconfiguration doesn't make sense because the programs that exist and are successful are all K-8. Part of what has made these programs successful is exactly BECAUSE they are K-8. To change that is too much risk when so much appears to already be changing.</li><li>Students currently in grades 6-8 have already had their most social, adolescent, preteen time disrupted by COVID. Now is not the time to disturb them more by destroying their current learning environment.</li><li>I am extremely bothered by the idea of the grade reconfiguration. Research and recent IPS experience have shown that the K-8 model is more beneficial to students than standalone middle schools. On one hand the proposal suggests replicating high-performing programs but then also proposes completing changing those existing programs. Shifting from K-8 to K-5 and 6-8 is not an expansion of a program. It is a dismantling of a program. I do support replicating programs. I do not support dismantling them. K-8 programs work (including neighborhood schools, not just choice schools) and are much more beneficial to all students than large middle schools. IPS tried large middle schools for many years but they failed year after year. Just a few years ago IPS finally acknowledged that the middle schools were failing our students and switched to offering more K-8 schools, including neighborhood schools. Why would we now consider returning to that failed model? As a parent, I absolutely do not want to send my daughter to a large middle school. She will be lost in a sea of 6th-8th graders. As a special education teacher who works with 7th-8th graders in a K-8 school, I absolutely would not want to move to a large stand-alone middle school. The school I teach at is over capacity with 600+ students. I would not consider the school a "small school" but by having K-8th grades, there are fewer students per grade level. This results in providing the benefits of a small school environment for students while also maximizing the use of the building. Staff are able to provide focused instruction and care to each student. Enrichment opportunities are abundant. From what I have seen in my 20+ years of teaching in IPS, switching to a district-wide K-5 and 6-8 model would be devastating to our students. I sincerely hope that you reconsider this part of the proposal.</li><li>Where can we cut costs in ways that allow students to still have close relationships with staff? As bigger schools often mean causes those relationships to be more distant. I wonder if we could cut in areas such as technology for younger students, administrative salaries and other costs, and in petitioning the state to drop ILearn (as Florida just did with standardized tests) and allow schools to use that money to hire more staff</li><li>The elimination of the K-8 model. We believe in the irreplaceable value of keeping students in one school through 8th grade. Perhaps there could be workarounds—-could Montessori/cfi/butler lab each continue with their own dedicated middle school?</li><li>What makes choice schools higher performing? Is it the small size, parent involvement, curriculum? We need to be sure that when scaling these options we don't lose what makes them strong. We absolutely need more equity in these options, but I think some of the advantage was in the middle years kids being able to mentor or be leaders for the younger children in the school. My biggest concern of options is eliminating k-8 format.</li><li>I don't think you care about parent feedback. If you did, you would have made this survey easier to find and easier to complete. I am worried that the students of IPS will continue to be guinea pigs for this innovation model. I am worried that K-8 might just stay at choice schools, but that you will say neighborhood schools will have to shift to K5 only, which shows that you don't really care that K-8 would benefit all students, especially those in neighborhood schools. Where are 6-8 students going to go - Arlington and Northwest? That will be disastrous.</li><li>Do not get rid of K-8 model. Research supports this Groupon my for academic and social emotional gains.</li><li>Most of these items support except for the middle school idea. Its best these kids attend K-8 instead of put into there own school. What does education research say on both side of middle school versus not.</li><li>Will removing proximity keep siblings in the same schools easing the burden on families to transport children and building strong community within a school for families?</li><li>Worried about splitting k-8</li><li>I'm hopeful that we support the reconfigured schools with internal systems (grading, discipline, etc.) that do not perpetuate racism and classism.</li><li>I do not want schools restructured from their current grade levels-it will cause us to potentially leave IPS</li><li>Worry about schools that are already successfully modeling K-8 with great success. The communities are thriving and benefit children in so many ways by lengthening the span of time they build relationships with peers and teachers and administration. This is not a helpful solution. Many children's families have chosen these schools because they are K-8 and have made many family decisions based on this being how things will continue. I do not support this change.</li><li>I worry about changing from K-8 to K-5. I made the choice of the school we are at because of the K-8 option would mean less transitions and because the number of classes per grade were smaller. This enhances the community feel of the school. I also worry about proximity being eliminated completely. I’d like to see what the proposed enrollment zones would look like. I would hesitate sending my child to a school that was not in close proximity.</li><li>I do believe( and want) that every school should be a great school!!! I like that the proximity zone could be taken away. That is a huge step. Everyone should have the choice of where their child goes to school. If you are in the IPS school district you should be able to attend a school that is right for your child. I do not like the idea of changing schools from K-8 to K-5 and middle schools. I do not like the idea of middle school. I think we need to make all the existing IPS schools all K-8. I think that you have better involvement from parents and the community when you have K-8 schools. I worry about younger siblings when their older siblings are at another school. Who walks them to and from school?? Just some safety concerns. Easier for parents to have their children at one school. Thank you for all of this hard work.</li><li>Again, I am anxious about dividing all schools into elementary (k-5) and middle school (6-8) across the board. My children attend a school that accommodates grades kindergarten through eighth. Its design is very deliberate, and I would hate to see its coherent and effective philosophy of education compromised lost if the new proposal is implemented.</li><li>Worried about dismantling the K-8 model — we must maintain for the social and educational wellbeing of our communities, especially in these post-pandemic years.</li><li>I am skeptical that the proposals will impact the situations so cleanly as stated, as the descriptions seem overly simplistic and optimistic. For example, to change a K-8 school into a K-5 will fundamentally alter its core, and will potentially be negatively altered. To change something by removing parts of it, and then adding a higher number of lower age students, will not necessarily maintain the successful previous outcomes.</li><li>I agree with more great schools. Disagree with grade reconfiguration. I don't think that IPS will be able "provide excellent, robust offerings in all schools". I like that my girls will only attend two IPS schools. I don't trust that in 2-5 years you won't start talking about cuts and closures again. Unless you start cutting salaries in the administration levels and working with city and state officials to get tax and boundary issues changed, you'll always be in this boat. The issue comes down to money as the place to begin change, and you don't have it. So if you implement one or more of these solutions will me kids be kicked out if their current school?</li><li>Changing schools that are working worries me because it could change what families stay in IPS at all if they want a K-8 option. Teachers will leave IPS- excellent teachers, who create those successful schools. Treating the symptoms, problems of IPS, with band-aids will not create lasting change. Speak truth to what teachers do for students and families in Indy. Create better working conditions for those teachers. Listen and ask them before you make changes.</li><li>Splitting schools. Think about what is best for families of all social-economic, diverse backgrounds. It’s a hard time already. Why make it harder on parents/guardians to get their kids to school &amp; why change it when it’s working. Work harder &amp; spend that budget on improving the schools are currently failing.</li><li>The grade reconfiguration solution seems highly flawed. If it’s those programs that are most successful why on earth would IPS want to dismantle that? IPS cannot attempt to replicate successful programs AND tear apart the k-8 model. Focus on replicating the programs that work. Not both.</li><li>Changing to a K-5 and 6-8 model. Those kids are much better off in their elementary schools than in a huge school with teens and preteens where no one knows them well. TERRIBLE IDEA. Also, why are we not talking about spending less money on opening new innovation schools right and left? Why is there always money for that?</li><li>When looking at stability and enrollment for all schools- neighborhood schools are serving different demographics of students. When students are moving in and out of district boundaries the neighborhood schools are serving that population. They are responding to high and changing need, what additional supports are they receiving? As large changes are being made they will likely be asked to manage a continually increasing need- what supports are being put in place before these changes are being made? Choice schools have more stability because of the lottery, neighborhood schools are responding to need as it arrives. -Staffing- There is a nation wide teacher shortage. What plan is in place to support all staff through these large changes? What will be required of staff through these changes? Will staff have say over where they are moved? What kind of damage do we cause to the built communities and relationships? - I am passionate about my neighborhood school. I want to see it valued by the district. We miss out so many vibrant and full connections when we do not invest in our neighborhood schools fully. -FACE coordinators or other support staffing for transitionsWill there be staff placed in buildings that are experiencing transitions/changes/closure? Not all schools have a FACE coordinator, often it is schools who need resources, grants, programming (and would benefit from it most) that have had to allocate that funding somewhere more urgent. I want to know if there are plans for that type of support. Enrollment zones/geographical zones- What will be done to ensure there are equitable options in all zones? Our choice schools and programing is not currently spread equally throughout the district. How will schools be assigned new teaching philosophy and programming to be sure all zones offer the same options? What extra training will be given to teachers and schools as programming changes? How will teachers be adequately compensated for the increased training that would require?</li><li>I wonder how many families in neighborhood schools would want their neighborhood school changed into a choice school. Do you have data about this? It seems like most IPS choice schools that are popular and successful are more oriented towards less traditional educational models but when caregivers pull their kids from IPS, they often choose a charter school option that is more structured and traditional. Is this because those are the only options or is it because traditional academic rigor is what is appealing? It seems like this is information we could get if we work hard enough for it. I also wonder what kind of 6-8 schools are being considered. Middle school is pretty tough, overall, no matter how it is offered. What would this look like for kids who have been in k-8 schools?</li><li>I don't have concerns or worries, I do have some wonderings: With the new age configuration, have we thought about why we have families leave us when transitioning buildings (6th to 7th grade)? What I hear from parents is that it is because they are worried about the other students who are feeding into the middle school and that their kiddos may experience more of a 'rough' group of students. What IF we created schools that are PreK-4 and then 5-8, where the 5-8 buildings had 5th and 6th clustered in one part of the building and 7/8 in another part. The students from the K-4 would all transition to the 5-8 building together, and not combine with other students from another K-4. The first combination of schools would be at the high school level where students choose their school depending on their future goals. This way the families know the transition to 5th from 4th with all the same students but to a new building. Would we put money into more transportation to support more mobile students staying at the same school for the year? Would a process be developed on how the staffing on each building would be determined if a building is to close?</li><li>Many questions and wonderings have already been addressed.</li><li>Why can’t we offer the robust programs to maybe two or three schools near each other? How is making a drive/bus ride to lower income students beneficial? Where could you take money away to actually apply it to students and teachers? Appreciate your teachers in ways that matter.</li><li>Grade reconfiguration - moving from the K-8 model. It seems that these choice schools currently operating as K-8 are highly successful, I don't understand why you would move away from that rather than trying to replicate success, especially with middle school being an often tumultuous time for students.</li><li>Sibling preference is something that matters to all parents, regardless of income or neighborhood so should be considered carefully.</li><li>I am very concerned about grade reconfiguration and school consolidation.</li><li>Concern about moving from a K-8 model. The proposed solution of separating 7-8, is not valid.</li><li>I am concerned about changing from the k-8 model in some schools to separate middle schools. I like the idea of less transitions for students. I think the students and staff know each other well by the time they get to middle school and that can help them be successful in a safe place. I think it will provide more stability during challenging years of early adolescence.</li><li>I totally agree with replicating the success of models like Montessori and CFI. However, it does not make sense to disrupt the success of those models, which are all K-8. This risks damaging part of the system that is working. Better to make more of these schools as K-8, rather than damaging a working system.</li><li>I worry if the parents who are against this will actually be listened to because it's not in the best interest of a lot of children.</li><li>Based on my experience at Sidener, I am not confident that there are enough highly qualified teachers in the district to replicate the rigor that high performing students and students with special needs require. I'm also not confident that these things exist in the current structure. I think replication without substantial teacher training is a recipe for disaster.</li><li>I am worried about Sidener being closed. It's a different school from those high demand ones (CFI and Lab schools I assume) that it's serving high ability students with varied curriculum to really meet the students academic needs. Also, I find the student body make up at Sidener very representative of the overall school district (over 50% African American) and high proportion of lower SES students. So, given the schools will be K-5, I am wondering if Sidener will be closed due to its unique nature and unique set of students it's serving. To me that seems like the opposite of what the district is trying to do. The students at Sidener seem very happy and the principal is a top notch educator that really understands each students (they have many students with IEP who are twiceexceptional) who have many different levels of academics. Also, I find the 2-8grade structure at Sidener a must. These students have completely individualized curriculums and continuing at the same school across the grades really make sense for a student to receive uninterrupted individualized curriculum. In short, I am worried that this plan will close down schools like Sidener that is actually a model for what the plan is trying to achieve.</li><li>Please ensure that there continues to be a strong Sidener Academy.</li><li>I am very worried about the changing schools from K-6 and K-8 to being just elementary and middle schools. This seems like an awful, terrible, and just plain bad decision. As a Montessori middle schooler, I am upset about the plan being to just get rid of offering the Montessori middle school option in ips. I am also upset that the Montessori and CFI schools would just all be tossed into one school, that isn’t equitable or fair. It makes me extremely mad as a special needs kid who has special needs siblings and friends that you would just throw special needs kids into a new environment, with new teachers, new people, and new requirements. That seems extremely unfair to me and my peers. I love the way the schools are run now and would hate changing it. With all the things ips has been doing recently, it honestly seems like ips is just trying to make things worse. There’s nothing wrong with the way the schools are run now, and NOTHING about the K-6, K-8, and 6-8 situation should be changed.</li><li>These possibilities seem predetermined and not necessarily reflective of community feedback</li><li>Strong NO to increasing seats in higher performing schools - larger class sizes are not beneficial! Keep in mind that when expanding the popular choice schools that it costs a lot of money to train people in these programs. By expanding too much, we could lose the integrity of the program. Would love to keep considering grade configuration. This is one way we could increase seats at higher performing schools (could add a classroom to each grade level by moving the middle school to their own school). A lot of times principals only have background in elementary or middle school and it is apparent with how they run the school.I'm worried that completing eliminating the proximity preference could lead to more families leaving IPS. In certain neighborhoods, there are families that would not go to a different neighborhood/local school if they didn't get into one of the choice schools.</li><li>Smaller schools also provide a better chance for growth. Teachers know all the kids from kindergarten, creating relationships early.</li><li>How many buildings will be closed with the grade level reconfigurations? How much money will IPS save by reconfiguring grade levels? Even with a great amount of planning, research and financial investment the merged programs that will form 6-8 grade buildings will not be as successful as they are in their present K-8 learning environment. Why must K-8 configurations that are successful be dismantled?</li><li>Worried about neighborhoods and the possibility of busing students away from homes.</li><li>I'm concerned about the specific conditions for closing neighborhood schools that are quality schools, but have low enrollment/utilization. Also, a quality school isn't just about test scores, particularly when dealing with transient student populations.</li><li>My main concern is that students won't have a connection with a school.</li><li>Many years ago, IPS moved towards k-8 models in an effort to keep &amp; best support our middle school students. At that time, we were losing a lot of middle school students to other schools &amp; our stand alone middle schools struggled with behaviors &amp; test scores. Are these no longer concerns of the district? We have seen that it is not easy to replicate choice programs &amp; maintain the integrity of the programs. This has been especially true when trying to replicate &amp; grow too quickly. What is the plan to make sure this replication is well thought out &amp; staff members are properly trained?</li><li>Eliminating neighborhood schools increases the strain on families who struggle with transportation: 1) Relative to extracurricular participation and after-school activities, and 2) also potentially with daily school-day attendance as we have unfortunately seen!</li><li>The Montessori option program will still be PK-8? It said you would have K-5 and 6-8 schools… it is a strong community within the school. The families like to stay at one school for 9-10 years. That is one draw to the building. A lot of middle school Students need small school environment for academic learning. That is what makes the middle school students successful and they are fully prepared for high school.There is only one without a secure entrance. This was a referendum item several years back… where is that money that the tax payers voted yes too and still has not been done? If something is going to happen to the building or the Montessori program, it would be nice for staff to know before it is released to the public… and not just from building admin but someone on this committee.</li><li>I like putting the district into zones and getting rid of priority boundaries. I think that will make things more equitable, but not solve the problem with the east side school being ostracized or 84 being privileged. Would east side kids really want to go to 84 where there is little representation of their demographic? I am appalled at the idea of creating K-5 schools and 6-8s. I teach at and my children attend a K-8. In one breath you said we need to replicate successful programs and in another you state that you want to change grade configurations. Have you connected that part of what makes the K-8 schools successful IS there grade configuration? I have a child with an IEP and another with a 504- when they entered MS in 6th grade (6th grade is MS at their building) they were known. They had 3 teachers to get to know instead of 6 or 7 and their teachers had the capability to really reflect on their IEPS and consult their resource teachers. They were not one of 30-40 kids with IEPs or 504s out of the 150-200 students a traditional middle school teacher has. Their previous teachers were also able to weigh in on their needs in that transition to MS. They were known in the building for 6-7 years before stepping foot in their 6th grade classroom. If relationship is the key to success for students, why are we ending those relationships at such a tender time in development?</li><li>Will there be enough teachers to teach if we're increasing the number of teachers at schools?</li><li>I worry about Spanish immersion curriculum in middle and high school grades. A city the size of Indianapolis should have a Spanish immersion program that spans preK-12, and IPS is well poised to offer this.</li><li>how do we meet the needs of students requiring extra homework assistance?</li><li>Slides 20 &amp; 21 contradict each other. Part of what makes the k-8 schools better performing (especially at the upper grade levels) is the mixed ages. They don’t have classes together obviously, but they remember what it’s like to be a little looking up to the bigs. They look forward to the days when they are the big kid, doing the big kid things. They are invested in their education from day one because they can see what it will look like. Kids don’t think about college because they have no reference but they think about middle school, with their friends, and the teachers they expect to have. The teachers in a small learning community of a k-8 building have relationships with all kidsones they haven’t gotten yet but will some day and the ones that they had and will always cherish and remember. Middle school kids come back to the lower classes to volunteer during a study hall, to visit for a minute as they past by in the hall, they come back on graduation day to appreciate what was given to them many years ago. Kids are invested in education and isn’t that they point of it all? When you copy the successful k8 schools, you won’t see that in the first few years but success with time, with relationship building, with small learning communities, with people invested (students and families) in a school that can be there’d for NINE years… the possibilities are truly endless. I also have to say that the k-8 is a draw from out of district and even Kees people from going private. IPS needs to strongly consider a loss of money with an exodus of families at sixth grade now instead of just at high school. How will that money impact what you can actually accomplish in a 6-8 middle school.</li><li>A key component to the success of choice schools seems to be their pedagogy and lots of investment in staff. Do you realize that it’s not easy to replicate unless the admin and staff buys in? Thanks for separating K-5 from 6-8. I haven’t seen good middle school instruction in IPS since the move to K-8. And I hate seeing the “big kids” plow over the littles in the elementary school buildings.</li><li>Eliminating K-8 schools does a disservice to kids with "special needs", for lack of a better word. The more consistent the surroundings, the better the growth potential for these students.</li><li>Kids in same household not getting into same schools</li><li>If the k-8 building changes to middle school stand alone, I hope/wonder if there would be a phasing out so students who are in middle school at k-8 can finish their time without having to change schools for one or two years.</li><li>Disruption of school communities by this admin has caused more SEL problems than COVID. More shuffling of kids around is going to further long term harm to the community.</li><li>Again, there were no slides attached to this survey and no links provided, so I cannot comment on this.</li><li>Closing schools is not the answer. There's significant value added with k-8 schools. Charter and Choice school models are not the answer. As a parent I actively chose not to send my children to charter or choice model school.</li><li>NO CRITICAL RACE THERORY AT ALL!!!!</li></ul>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Focus on having great teachers, get rid of computers, our teachers have gotten used to relying on technology and are not teaching like the did pre covid.</li><li>I heard the proposal includes splitting our communities by ending K-8. I strongly encourage you to reconsider this. I am available by phone or email for more discussion.</li><li>Why proximity has been in place for good schools</li><li>Listening!</li><li>How does the district plan to keep high schoolers in district? With North Central being a high academic achieving school we are considering it or private high school over any IPS high school.</li><li>The situation with busing will need to be addressed if you move to a different geographic proximity model. Busing does not feel like a safe or viable option for us right now given the many issues with late or missing buses, challenging behaviors of bus drivers, etc. I expect this would be even more critical if you move to a new model. Busing will need to be safe, on time, and more widely available.</li><li>Students input</li><li>I see the benefit of the K-8 model, but I think having a separate middle school would help ease the transition to high school for many students. Everyone agrees we need more resources in the schools, but I'm not sure how the equity in underutilized buildings can be transferred to classroom resources. I agree that it is very important to create more resources outside of the northside. There are SO many schools on the northside of the district. We absolutely should be getting kids out of poorly maintained school buildings. love the idea of enrollment zones. Eliminating the proximity zone will do nothing if there are not sufficient resources to transport children safely and on time to those schools.</li><li>IPS is addressing the goal of 'stability'. I don't think that dismantling K-8 schools to create K-5's and 6-8's offers stability. This creates instability and anxiety for children. K-8 schools maintain familiarity with teachers, social-workers, nurses, administrators and support staff. Don't break up k-8 schools.</li><li>How to fund additional trained support staff not just warm bodies that get moved around buildings as "supports"</li><li>Take a deeper dive into why neighborhood schools are not working…. This should be the focus to then know how to correct neighborhood schools. Please don’t attack and dismantle the schools that are working, that the teachers, staff, and parents in the community worked so hard to Buld. Some choice schools are already maxed out with respect to classroom size and space. Increasing access for more students - will this also come with more teachers, and more classroom and facility space? Teachers are also asked to do so much with so little resources. Sustainability of quality of teaching is of utmost importance for the longevity of IPS and all of its community members.</li><li>Why add more schools to a district struggling with the schools that are already running? It would create bigger problems to start new middle schools</li><li>Keep k-8 buildings together. Do not separate middle schools!!</li><li>What does the 6-8 middle school look like: Will teaching style from choice school be maintained? How will transportation work? How will sibling preference be affected?</li><li>I am not sure. I agree that equity is an issue that needs to be addressed, and I applaud the work you are doing.</li><li>You need to view proximity schools as neighborhood schools cause that is what they really are. Most kids at my children’s school walk to school everyday which creates community, accountability for all the children in our neighborhood.</li><li>Risk of parents leaving school system causing further funding decrease making financial system worse.</li><li>The desire to be equitable sounds good, but will drive lower enrollment. Shift the current school approach to all K-8 schools and consolidate that way instead of splitting up existing K-8 schools.</li><li>I don’t know.</li><li>Slides?</li><li>Quote attribution, more numbers, how are composite scores calculated? Actual building numbers.</li><li>Nothing comes to mind about things that should be included that's not.</li><li>See above</li><li>Looking at the map, there are glaring places without IPS schools- I wonder if an overlay of charters would help explain why some areas don’t need an IPS school.</li><li>Given the questions/wonderings I bubbled up, I wish there were more on a communication/branding strategy for the coming changes as I feel that there is a really strong chance to create some synergies that propel all schools forward. Note, that the communication and planning that has gone into Rebuilding Stronger has been phenomenal. I am asking more about once decisions are made, how they are going to be communicated in a way that isn't so much about the changes themselves, but more about "building a stronger IPS for all?" Innovation Network Schools are not mentioned anywhere in the documents presented but we have a very strong connection to the district. The IPS logo is on everything we send out, we are in an IPS building, and we use IPS transportation, athletics, tech, and food services. In my context, we are proud partners with IPS and also have our transportation zones set by you all. Many of the points about enrollment zones also strike true with my school. Has there been any consideration of making "Enrollment Zones" encompassing of all schools under the IPS umbrella? For example, if I was a parent on the southside of the city, I could go onto the IPS site, and when I click on my "zone," I see that my options are "IPS Network Schools," which would be what is currently called Choice programs and Neighborhood schools and IPS Innovation Schools? Ultimately, I feel this would create a more unified brand of the school options and also work to have Innovation Network families feel more connected to the IPS brand and experience.</li><li>I would like to hear how this benefits/detracts from stakeholder groups individually.</li><li>More on the benefits of eliminating proximity boundaries. I think they are a valuable tool when used correctly.</li><li>School union response to these changes and if teachers support them.</li><li>I do agree that access to the successful models needs to be more accessible to all students. Replicating the successful schools is important, however, while maintaining the integrity of the programs as designed. It is important to know what zones will be created, how many zones will be created, how large the zones will span, and what “choice” programs will be available in each zone.</li><li>Why do we not seem to be including the idea of moving/opening Choice model schools in larger buildings? All the ones I know of are in old Elementary school buildings, which tend to be smaller. Since we are putting Prek-8 in a building that was probably built to house k-5 or 1-5, it seems obvious the buildings would be full unless the program is only medium successful. Larger buildings (or two buildings side by side) also help with enrichment programs. By having a larger number of students in each grade/age it would be easier to attract and keep these programs.</li><li>Impacts of proposed changes on existing choice programs and their scholars and faculty/staff</li><li>Strategic plan from each Principal and their gap analysis on their schools challenges.</li><li>I think you really need to stop and think before you make changes to programs that are working well. I know you are trying to be equitable and I appreciate that but I also know that there is a lot more that will go into serving everyone equally. If you alter the successful programs that have attracted the well educated white families - you will most definitely see an exodus of this core group that has means to choose other options. It is hard to hear but it is the truth. I would appreciate trying to put a CFI on the east side (38th/post) and see what happens before making changes to current structure. You need to try it out in an area that does not typically have the same level of success. I like your idea of zones. I think that would help with busing. I also think students should be allowed to apply out of zone if they want to provide their own transportation. This will all work best as a phased approach. I sure hope it is not an overnight change as has been done in the past. We were so disappointed by what happened to shortridge and now no longer consider it a high school option. I know other families have made the same choice as our enrollment from 84 to shortridge was ZERO this year. Please don’t do this to the k-8 experience too. You will lose the community and the families who have loved these schools. Please focus hard on community partnerships in low performing areas. Please do not make this a one size fits all solution because that is NOT the case. There is no easy answer but shortridge should serve as an example of what not to do.</li><li>How many innovation schools can be opened and in what timeframe? How long will it take for current students to benefit from these changes?</li><li>A plan to start school later than August 1.</li><li>I don't know how to factor this in, but it should be said. I student taught and taught in IPS choice and traditional schools. I currently teach in Lawrence Twp schools that face the same dynamic differences without the "choice" label. One of the biggest factors of a schools success, or not, is parent involvement. Everyone wants a choice opportunity for their kid, but it's work, and it should be for everyone involved (educators, kids, parents and the community). Every kid deserves to have educators believe in them, but kids need to see that their parent is part of the school community behind the educators. Without all four of above parties united in the same purpose, creating more "choice" schools will be bandaging the problem of student attrition rather than truly fixing the root cause</li><li>the quad map. IT DOESN"T INCLUDE A THERAPIST/COUNSELOR FOR SCHOOLS! There are many 'extra' services that are missing from schools!!!</li><li>How to keep successful schools going while helping other schools? Impact of losing families to private schools. Many of the families that will leave are the parents who volunteer the most and help schools succeed.</li><li>Leave schools alone. No restructuring of middle schools.</li><li>For schools with alternative learning styles, would there be middle school options that would continue building on these learning styles? Would well ducting middle school teams be kept together? Would certain elementary schools preferentially feed in to certain middle schools, to try and maintain continuity both from an academic and social/peer group standpoint?</li><li>There is a lack of recognition that many of the "high performing" schools are K-8. And I guarantee you that many parents selected a school at least in part because of that. We want stability for our children. We want to not have to worry about where they are going in both 6th AND 9th grades. And most people I know say their worst school experience by far was in a standalone 6-8 middle school. My middle schooler has none of the anxiousness about middle school that I had, that my husband had, because she is in a space she feels safe in, and has known since kindergarten. I fear that if that model comes to bear, and these highly desired choice schools, and well-attended, beloved neighborhood schools are no longer K-8, that IPS will see their student exodus at 6th grade, instead of at 9th.</li><li>You should have made it easier to find this survey in the first place.</li><li>I don't understand why dismantling the K-8 models that are currently working and in high demand is the only reconfiguration option you are considering. Why aren't we considering consolidating underutilized schools in each zone and create additional choice schools in those quadrants? The southwest quadrant is particularly needing options. The Montessori school offering a choice model is one that stands out as an example of how this is working in those underserved quadrants.</li><li>I hope staff at schools that may be closed will be given options about where to move rather than being automatically assigned.</li><li>If choice schools are in higher demand then it means they are performing well and we should learn from it. CFI 70 provides such an amazing experience, I wish so much for the school system to replicate their work to more schools. I realize some parents are looking for something else, but I honestly don't know why every IPS school isn't doing inquirybased education.</li><li>na</li><li>As soon as possible, it would be helpful to have a timeline of proposed changes to the schools (consolidating, reconfiguration, etc). As far as the Grade Reconfiguration and School Consolidation-are these broad terms that will be voted on in October or are specifics being voted on? i.e. Specific schools to be consolidated or just that IPS is going to move forward and look for opportunities to consolidate?</li><li>the impact this will have on specialized schools like Montessori school. This decision is very bad for our school. Please do not do this to the specialized Montessori schools</li><li>Big schools can offer more opportunities, programs, facilities. But they also come at a relationship cost. Our students do need enrichment opportunities. But they also need relationship stability and depth. Without that the value of the enrichment opportunities is diminished. As I said before, especially in neighborhoods where the family unit is struggling, schools and other community institutions have to be more than educators. Perhaps there is a way to do smaller schools on a campus that are able to share enrichment opportunities. But enrichment can't come at the expense of relationship.</li><li>You told us why adding middle schools is best for IPS financially, but I'd like to understand what those that study this type of thing say is best for students. From what I've seen of the K-8 model seems to be working pretty well. Also the change to middle schools means increased transportation which adds cost and time on a bus for students.</li><li>What new partnerships might be formed to increase the success of some schools? Might school consolidations be partnered with partnerships with new models (Paramount, Herron, Purdue, etc.) that have demonstrated success? Might community organizations serve as anchors for schools in a way that preserves belonging?</li><li>I think the other solutions on the table are good. Replicate the choice schools in other quadrants of the city! Why hasn't this been done already? Provide CFI, Lab and Montessori options in each zone of the city as k-8. And consolidate where demographic populations dictate. It seems to me that doing these two things alone could provide the sort of space utilization needed. I also endorse eliminating proximity zones.</li><li>Most parents who attended a separate 6th-8th middle school, which I did, remember those as really hard years. I'm not saying it's the 6th-8th model that is at fault, but perhaps it does not help? If we do move to a 6th-8th model, I would want those school to be feeder schools with the option of picking another middle school (if there is room). I don't think it helps students at that age to not experience stability in friendships or curriculum/learning models, nor to not have parents with strong inter-parent connections who can keep each other "in the loop" and have built foundations (from elementary years) from which to have those harder conversations (i.e. bullying, dating, etc.) that tend to arise at these ages.</li><li>Parent picked a choice school based on philosophies now that is being taken away at the most critical point of development at the middle school level which means parents will leave the IPS school district for other townships and private schools. Did you ask how many parents at current choice schools will leave if the K-8 system is dismantled?</li><li>Maintain a high ability school option, but to make it more accessible, move it to a location more central to the district. One of our children attends Sidener, but its distance from us and many other families makes it much more difficult to build community.</li><li>How does this impact Montessori? When you suggest replicating successful school models, I am certain the IPS Montessori program is one of the bests. If you take the time to understand its model and the multi-age benefits, it is imperative that these schools remain K-8. Please don't change what IS working. Montessori has become an educational model sometimes only offered to the privileged in many communities. What IPS has been able to offer through public Montessori settings is beautiful. It is an opportunity for all. I am so proud of that. The middle school students in the K-8 setting develop as leaders, role models, mentors, and peacemakers for the younger grades. Taking this opportunity away from the K-8 setting would negatively impact both the development of the elementary and middle school years.</li><li>Transportation</li><li>You should definitely be seeking feedback at every stage of the process, and you should have fewer open ended questions.</li><li>That IPS already tried the separate middle schools at least once and it wasn't very successful and many of the middle schools were closed. Why is this an option again if it's shown that parents are most likely to move their children out of district if they have to change schools after elementary. Why not keep the engagement through 8th grade. Is this change going to affect all schools (innovation and district run) or just district run schools? If it's only the district run schools why and why won't innovation schools have to follow suit?How much time are parents, teachers, and students going to have before their schools change format or close? Such a large change would need a few years to hammer everything down.</li><li>Any decent high schools</li><li>N/a</li><li>Increased school size isn't always a positive. Why are we not looking to replicate programs as K8 and to build partnerships and use technology across similar schools or nearby schools to help fill in the gaps and collaborate? Why is the focus just on replicating high demand programs and not on strengthening our neighborhood schools? Does IPS not realize that the intensive focus on innovation and charter partner schools have in many cases increased the fracturing of the district and created increased transportation costs? Too much choice can be as bad as too little.</li><li>What is the evidence that moving to stand alone middle schools will improve the district? The district middle schools had huge problems 20 years ago when the district moved to combined elementary and middle schools and the current stand alone middle schools are also struggling. How will you prevent these problems from immediately happening again in all these knew middle schools? Who will care for younger siblings and walk them home from the school or the bus when middle school siblings are on a different schedule? How will you prevent more children from dying walking to and from school when we already don't have enough crossing guards and bus drivers?How will students with IEPs experience continuity when they have to change schools multiple times and adapt to staff who do not know how to meet their needs? How do the teachers feel about these changes? Do the leaders of the schools that will be torn apart support these changes?</li><li>A focus on learning, merit and achievement - the only things a school should be focused on.</li><li>How can families partner with IPS to advocate for needed changes at a higher level?</li><li>If you are wanting to duplicate the high performing schools then, why are you dismantling the model that is working? These two solutions seem counter productive to each other. We have to consider that all elements of those schools are what are helping them be successful.</li><li>Answered above</li><li>Transportation must be fixed if school consolidation is going to work. Unreliable transportation or routes that are extremely long are a huge barrier for families wanting to consider schools that are not in their immediate area.</li><li>Programs that allow students to engage in mentorship programs with people in a higher socioeconomic ring than they are. This is actually a really great way to help dig kids out of the poverty trap. Help strengthen communication skills early on, help children identify the physical sensations associated with their emotions and bodies and communicate those things in a respectful and kind way, and watch violent crime dramatically decrease as well</li><li>much more information about the potential impacts for students in middle school or near approaching middle school</li><li>Consolidating the K-8 choice models that are sought after into ONE middle school each (one for CFI; one for Butler Lab; one for the Montessori choice.) Expand MS into each of the 4 consolidated HS making them jr/sr high schools?</li><li>What will happen to Sidener and gifted education?</li><li>How do you attract families to the schools. How are you showing the great things that are happening in IPS, where students go after high school, etc. Why are you not promoting IPS high schools inside of the K-8 schools? How do you intend to utilize IPS strengths in Culture, Community, and Curriculum?</li><li>Don't change Emma Donnan please</li><li>This need to be more public. The board needs to be honest why these items are being pushed. K-8 models need to be kept which would be in the kids best interest. Small schools vs larger school with not help test schools and will cause greater issues throughout the system.</li><li>What are the proposed enrollment zones and how large are they, how far might children be required to travel to get to school, how will splitting off grades affect choice school students, ie. will they remain in their programs (IB, Montessori, etc.)</li><li>NA</li><li>What is more can be more “robust/rigorous” by having stand alone middle schools?</li><li>Teaching all students what they need and not just letting high ability students and high performers coast.</li><li>It’s ok to own the fact that education as a field can’t do this alone. The work of equity and inclusion goes beyond the walls of the school, beyond the school day. I urge you to stop tinkering with kids and their families and focus on real systems change.</li><li>Our input bedsides a survey after you have already made these decisions</li><li>Focusing on better resources for families with kids with disabilities.</li><li>I would rather you find ways to enhance the underutilized schools and replicate what is working well at the successful schools, but do not disrupt those that are doing a tremendous job for its students and community. Thank you!</li><li>Unknown</li><li>Teacher retention, student voice.</li><li>Imagine you, being in a learning situation for 9 years (pk-7th) and then having to go a different school for one year before high school after your academic career has already been interrupted by a pandemic! All the changes you have proposed are great except removing the k-8 programs. Maybe it is something to look at again in a few years when COVID hasn’t impacted so many so much so recently. Student are at their most fragile state that we have ever seen! A shuffle is not what they need. I’m sure k-8s would give up some resources if they are truly getting so much more!</li><li>Closing schools</li><li>I didn't see much around engagement. Is this a concern in any of the under-performing schools?</li><li>Where are 6-8 students going to go? What if neighborhoods don't want a choice school model? Are you going to support them? Or prime them to be taken over by a Mind Trust graduate?</li><li>More detail of replication. Where will they be located will some of these schools that only have K-8 be expanded to high school option such as Montessori</li><li>How do IPS staff members feel about this proposed direction?</li><li>See previous comments</li><li>I would like to know what the proposed enrollment zones would look like.</li><li>Unsure</li><li>Applying the models that ARE working to underserved neighborhoods.</li><li>The teachers' role, importance, and opinions do not seem to be considered in the proportion that they should be. Great schools are made great most significantly by great teachers. Pay them more, and replicate their successful creations instead of making them change to fit the generic district model.</li><li>Cutting costs at the administration level. Working to change township and IPS boundaries, working to change unigov, working with state officials for help, working with the mayor's office. What are you doing at these levels? What is the real error of these problems? I feel like IPS is always blaming and putting on bandaids. I'm so tired of having to fight to keep my kids going to a good school and for a bus to show up.</li><li>Teacher input. Talking to and including input from families at the struggling schools; plus input from families at successful schools.</li><li>Using evidence based best practices in guiding district policies. We all know that sleep deprivation is harmful to our teenagers, but the district allowed it brecquse some parents were worried about losing school as their babysitter. High schoolers are being given a suboptimal learning environment and IPS is ok with it. My child was always a morning person until his teenage years, and then like thd research shows, his internal clock changed. He hates high school ONLY because he is exhausted all the time from getting up at 5am and it's honestly not realistic to think he can be in bed by 8pm with qthletics qnd a job and chores &amp; homework. Do what you have to.</li><li>Utilization of buildings- for smaller schools that have lower building utilization. Can space in these buildings be used for other district or community organizational need? Can other district buildings be closed and offices be moved into under utilized buildings?</li><li>George Julian houses the Programs for Young Children offices and testing. Is this being considered in the calculation of building cost and building utilization?</li><li>Can this be considered for other buildings? Is there a way to make this financially support programming at the school that is housing it?</li><li>I’m really not sure what the answers are. I’m not sure we have asked all the questions yet.</li><li>NA</li><li>Nothing at this time</li><li>If teachers were really valued and compensated, you wouldn’t have a shortage. I speak from experience as I have now moved out of the classroom and into another education role with more flexibility, more consideration for my own family as well as the children I serve and better pay.</li><li>How you will replicate successful schools rather than make them larger. I think doing away with proximity will help with equality, but the idea of making the current successful schools larger rather than leaving them as is and modifying struggling schools doesn't make sense to me. Why disrupt something that is working?</li><li>A review of what approaches have been tried in the past and their associated successes and challenges should be a transparent part of this conversation and decision making. I went to elementary at #86 and I remember the trend had been to have open classrooms. 10 years later each room had makeshift walls made from bookcases. Let's not forget to review what we know about our own district and make decisions that include that history.</li><li>What will happen to enrollment when you make some of these changes.</li><li>Ways to facilitate the different learning styles of students. Programs designed to accommodate a more inclusive learning environment where students are encouraged to learn at their own pace. How will you ensure that students who do not perform at the same pace don't get left behind.</li><li>I would just be curious for a little more detail on the plans, such as how and when they would be implemented.</li><li>Teacher training, re-training, re-tooling, and profession development are necessary to ensure the success of these changes. This cannot be done in a week. This will require sustained, intense training. I'm not confident that this degree of training has occurred, based on my reading of the proposal.</li><li>It should have included a longer period and more open meeting for parents to learn of the plan</li><li>Please put a cap on class size in schools if you're considering closing schools or reconfiguring schools. (recommendation: K: 20, 1-2: 24, 3-5: 26)</li><li>Larger schools might cut down on costs, but it will increase students leaving our district. They will get lost</li><li>A detailed timeline for development and launching of grade reconfigurations needs to communicated. In addition, the fact that K-8 choice schools are successful because this configuration is an intentional part of the school’s life, academics, community and overall success has been overlooked.</li><li>Focus on IPS - should not focus on innovation/charter schools.</li><li>How can we improve the space for our existing schools.</li><li>I strongly believe the key to a quality school is a stable &amp; qualified staff. The best of programs can not be successful if the staff is ever changing. What is IPS doing to keep quality teachers?</li><li>A district-wide grade configuration change is an opportunity to ensure that we have robust Arts Education Programs at every building, eliminating disparities, providing motivations to attend daily, and building foundations for positive and engaging school culture.</li><li>I feel you needed to have a meeting with just teaching staff and get their opinion and experience. We are the ones that are in the trenches everyday teaching in these buildings and with these students. The teacher voice needs to be open to all teachers, just not a select few. I know you have offered these surveys, but the in person voice is powerful.</li><li>If a type of choice school isn't included in your zone, will you not be able to attend?</li><li>Commitment to linguistic diversity, multilingual preparation, and critical history.</li><li>language access</li><li>IPS needs to strongly consider a loss of money with an exodus of families at sixth grade now instead of just at high school.</li><li>Cut the fat at the top levels of administration. What is spent in salary and benefits there should be invested in the actual school buildings and student-facing resources. It’s really gross to hear the rhetoric about equity when leadership and admin costs consume so much of the budget. Act like you mean it.</li><li>Maybe you should work to ensure all the options of "choice" schools are available in each geographic area. (e.g. Right now there are only 2 lab schools, 2 Montessori schools, etc., and they are not well distributed in the district.) Choice expansion - away from proximity priority - creates a transportation issue that will be extremely difficult to overcome. (Lack of bussing disproportionately affects minority families, too.)</li><li>See above</li><li>A better visual representation of the plan being directed. Maps, numbers of kids affected and where?</li><li>You should have included the slides, since you asked questions about them. You should also have a fair and transparent process of decision making that is based on taxpayers' opinions, and is democratic, rather than based on top-down decisions. It would also be helpful to also quantitative questions in addition to these qualitative ones, to get an overall sense of current opinion of key IPS stakeholders.</li><li>Charter and Choice school models are not the answer. As a parent I actively chose not to send my children to charter or choice model school.</li><li>you don't mention that NO CRT or political jargon will be permitted to be spoken to our kids while in school - NO TEACHER'S PERSONAL OPINION</li></ul>

<h2><strong>About Us</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Organized in 1970, the Indianapolis Public Schools Police Department consisted of 40 unarmed security guards and was titled IPS Security. In 1997, the department transitioned to the employment and training of sworn, armed police officers. Today, the department consists of 46 staff members, including officers, investigators, sergeants, dispatchers, and the police chief and captain.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Operating 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, the IPS Police Department serves more than 31,000 students and families throughout the district. Officers in these schools and neighborhoods serve as school resource officers, committed to providing support to all IPS properties, students, staff and families. Officers seek to create positive interactions and build relationships across our community through their assignments.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p>At IPS Health Services, we believe that parents and caregivers play an important role in ensuring their child's health and well-being. To help us provide the best possible care to your child while they are at school, we require certain health forms to be completed and submitted. These forms help us understand your child's individual health needs and ensure that we can provide the best possible care.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Required Forms</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are several required health forms that must be completed and submitted before your child can attend school. These forms provide us with important information about your child's health and help us understand their individual health needs. By submitting these forms, you are helping us ensure that your child is healthy and ready to learn.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Optional Forms</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition to the required forms, we offer several optional forms that you may choose to complete. These forms provide us with additional information about your child's health needs and help us provide appropriate care when necessary. While completion of these forms is optional, we encourage families to complete them if they feel they will be beneficial for their child's health.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Submitting Forms</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Submitting health forms is easy and can be done in person, by mail, or by email. We encourage families to submit forms as soon as possible to ensure that we have up-to-date information about your child's health. If you have any questions or concerns about submitting forms, please don't hesitate to contact us.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We understand that filling out health forms can be time-consuming, but completing these forms is important to ensure that we can provide appropriate health care to your child while they are at school. We thank you for your cooperation in helping us support your child's health and well-being.</p>

<p>At IPS Health Services, we are committed to ensuring that our students are healthy and ready to learn. Our Student Health Services provide a range of health services to support our students' physical health needs. Our staff is dedicated to providing quality care to all of our students.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Physical Exams</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Regular physical exams are an important part of maintaining good physical health. We encourage all students to have an annual physical exam with their healthcare provider. If your child does not have a healthcare provider, we can provide information on low-cost or free clinics in the area. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that all children have a well-child visit at least once a year. You can find more information on the American Academy of Pediatrics website.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Immunizations</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Immunizations are an important part of maintaining good health and preventing the spread of infectious diseases. Indiana state law requires that all students be up-to-date on their immunizations before attending school. We strongly encourage families to ensure that their child is up-to-date on all required immunizations. You can find more information on required immunizations on the Indiana Department of Health website.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Vision and Hearing Screenings</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Good vision and hearing are important for learning and overall health. We provide vision and hearing screenings to all students as part of our Student Health Services. If a screening indicates that your child may have a vision or hearing problem, we will notify you and provide recommendations for follow-up care. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that children have regular vision and hearing screenings. You can find more information on vision and hearing screenings on the American Academy of Pediatrics website.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We hope that we can help support and promote the health and well-being of our students. If you have any questions or concerns about your child's health, please don't hesitate to contact us.</p>
