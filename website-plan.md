# Enhanced Communication: Rebuilding Stronger Website Redesign

The district is embarking on a website redesign project to elevate communication and deliver a superior user experience for staff, parents, and students that aligns with Rebuilding Stronger's academic evolution. This document highlights the essential technical & functional requirements and plugins needed for the project.

# Key Technical & Functional Requirements

*   **Document Management System**: A robust system capable of handling links, documents including images, videos, audio files, PDFs, and post content. It should offer comprehensive version control features to archive and access previous document versions. Access control features must ensure that only authorized users can access, modify, or delete documents. 
*   **Media Document Management**: The system should prevent non-admin users from deleting media documents. Instead, users without deletion permissions should be able to replace documents with updated versions, ensuring media documents remain current and accessible. 
*   **Blog Posting**: Enable users to create and publish blog stories on their individual websites, featuring text, images, videos, and other media. Users should manage their blog posts without requiring admin privileges.
*   **Virtual File Organization**: An easy-to-use virtual file organization system that helps users navigate and find documents with support for nested folders, tags, and search functionalities. These folders should be user-specific, allowing everyone to set custom preferences. 
*   **Complex Tables**: Website infrastructure should support complex tables with features like sorting, filtering, and pagination. 
*   **Third-party Data Sources**: The system must consume third-party data sources, such as APIs, to display data dynamically on the website. 
*   **Code Development**: Allow for one-off code development to support custom functionality and integrations. 
*   **Program-based Design Approach**: Websites should adopt a program-based approach, modeling the upcoming Rebuilding Stronger initiative, instead of individual school websites, ensuring information consistency. Schools without a program will maintain their unique site. 
*   **Content Approval Mechanism**: Implement a content approval mechanism to ensure all content is vetted and approved before non-administrator users publish it on the website. 
*   **Language Translation**: Include a language translation feature to cater to non-English speaking users. The translation feature should support popular languages and be user-friendly. 
*   **Improved Calendar System**: Support an advanced calendar system that integrates with multiple vendors for seamless scheduling and event management.
*   **Staff Custom Post Type**: Enable the creation of custom post types for staff members to create and manage their staff pages. 
*   **Block Management System**: A tightly regulated block management system is necessary to prevent users from being overwhelmed by numerous block choices available in the block editor. 
*   **Page Builder System**: A powerful page builder system that allows experienced users to create diverse content layouts without custom code. The system should support templating for content reuse in multiple locations and integrate with the native block editor system for long-term support. 
*   **Integration with Let's Talk**: Leverage the Let's Talk system extensively to streamline communication and feedback between users and district and school staff. 
*   **Removal of External Requests**: Remove all external requests and services, such as Google Drive, Word Fence, Facebook feeds, and contact forms, to enhance security and eliminate external authentication requests. 
*   **Redirection Service**: Implement a redirection service within the website infrastructure to enable short link creation and tracking for each website.

# Unified Visual Design

## School, Program, and Model

The website's visual layout has been thoughtfully crafted to embody the school's identity and deliver a seamless user experience across all devices. A collaboration with VOX resulted in a homepage that captures the essence of the school and presents crucial information in a well-organized manner.

*   Homepage:
    *   The school colors are prominently displayed throughout the website, forging a powerful visual connection to the school's identity. For program websites with multiple buildings, a dedicated section below the news segment exhibits the logo, building details, and a link to a school-specific page on that program website.
*   Header:
    *   The header showcases the school logo on the left, accompanied by the title. On the opposite end, a circular button opens the navigation menu, ensuring a sleek and consistent interface across all devices.
*   Hero Image:
    *   The hero image features a block on the left, housing the page title and a concise description, enhanced by a color bar representing the school colors.
*   Welcome Section:
    *   After the hero image, a welcome heading introduces the school, followed by a brief description and an eye-catching ribbon design displaying three key facts about the school.
*   Latest School News:
    *   This segment highlights the six most recent news stories, complete with a title and featured image (if available). A button below the news stories navigates users to a blog post page containing all news items.
*   Special Highlight:
    *   Another hero image spotlights a distinctive aspect of the school, such as a unique food pantry, academic option, or historical fact. This image links to a dedicated page with more information.
*   Footer:
    *   The footer presents the school's name, address, student hours, office hours, and social media links, all editable by the school. Furthermore, prominent text about website accessibility and Title IX reporting ensures compliance with federal law requirements.

## District Homepage

The district homepage maintains a harmonious visual layout with the school websites, preserving a consistent design language throughout the district's online presence. The district homepage incorporates additional elements catering to a wider audience, supplying vital information and resources for the entire district.

*   Video Elements:
    *   Engaging video content on the district homepage connects with visitors and effectively conveys essential messages. Videos can highlight district-wide initiatives, showcase success stories, and provide updates on current events.
*   Icon Quicklinks:
    *   A collection of easily recognizable icon quicklinks grants users convenient access to crucial resources and frequently visited pages. These may include online portals, school directories, district calendars, and contact information for key district personnel.
*   Strategic Plan Focus:
    *   The special highlight section on the district homepage underscores the district's strategic plan, exhibiting its vision, mission, and core values. This section can feature a blend of text, images, and videos that communicate the district's dedication to promoting academic excellence and nurturing student growth.

By integrating these supplementary components into the district homepage, the website provides a comprehensive and captivating platform that addresses the diverse needs of the district's community members. The cohesive design language and uniform layout guarantee a smooth user experience while effectively showcasing the district's initiatives and priorities.

# Streamlined Organizational Structure

## District

Acts as the central hub for district information, including news, events, academic programs, and administrative services. This site is vital for students, parents, and educators to stay informed and engaged with the IPS community. Programs in the "Selective Recommendation Programs" section will also be incorporated into the district site.

### Selective Recommendation Programs

Tailored programs cater to specific groups of students, such as those with special needs or seeking accelerated learning opportunities. Students are chosen based on their academic abilities and interests, receiving customized educational experiences to foster their individual growth and development.

## Career-Themed Academies

Specialized programs within career-themed academies offer focused education and training to prepare students for their chosen careers, allowing them to gain practical skills and experience in their fields of interest.

All participating schools will adopt a single design model. Individual schools will not share information architecture or website infrastructure.

## Recommended for Removal

Schools no longer serving the district due to Rebuilding Stronger changes are recommended for complete website removal.

## Non-participating Innovation Programs

Provide unique educational experiences and specialized skill development opportunities, offering teachers and staff a high degree of autonomy to create and implement innovative curricula and teaching methods. **These websites are not considered in this plan.**

# Essential Technical Infrastructure

## Sending Messages from Website

The website will transition from SMTP authentication for email sending, necessitating collaboration with the Information Technology department to whitelist emails from the website's IP address. This enables the website to send crucial messages, such as reports and password resets. WordPress's built-in email function will be used for sending emails moving forward.

## Content Management System

WordPress, a versatile and user-friendly Content Management System (CMS), is employed by IPS website for its customization capabilities and multisite features, allowing users to manage multiple websites with a single WordPress installation. This provides an effortless content creation and publishing experience without requiring extensive technical expertise.

## Streamlined Information & Media Retention Strategy

In our ongoing efforts to minimize technical debt and optimize our website infrastructure, we are introducing a streamlined Information & Media Retention Strategy. The primary goal of this strategy is to maintain only up-to-date and pertinent content on the website, thereby reducing backend storage demands and enhancing website performance.

The Information & Media Retention Strategy will adhere to the following guidelines:

*   An annual review of all media and content on the website will be conducted to assess relevance and utility. Any outdated or irrelevant media or content will be removed from the website.
*   The website will only store media and content from the current school year and the previous school year. All media and content from earlier years will be eliminated, effectively reducing backend storage requirements.
*   Site Editors will have the flexibility to group and download their media at any time. This ensures that they can access their content within the designated retention period and store it according to their unique archival strategies.
*   In cases of school consolidation, the information and media from the affected schools will be migrated, following the pattern of retaining content from the current and previous school year. This guarantees that essential information is preserved during the consolidation process.

By implementing these guidelines, we strive to diminish technical debt, boost website performance, and guarantee that only current and relevant information is housed on the website.
