5.  **Community partners**: Local organizations, businesses, and community members can offer valuable input on how the websites can better serve the broader community.

## Ensuring Input from All Users

To gather feedback and input from our diverse stakeholders, we will use various methods, including:

1.  **Surveys and questionnaires**: Distribute online surveys to collect feedback on website features, design, and content priorities from all stakeholder groups.
2.  **Focus groups**: Conduct focus group discussions with representatives from key participant groups to delve deeper into their specific needs and preferences.
3.  **User testing**: Involve stakeholders in the testing process, allowing them to interact with the redesigned websites and provide feedback on their user experience.
4.  **Open forums**: Host public online discussion sessions, inviting stakeholders to share their thoughts and ideas on the website redesign process.

## Keeping Everyone Informed and Involved

To maintain stakeholder engagement and build trust throughout the redesign process, we will implement a transparent and consistent communication strategy. This may include:

1.  **Progress updates**: Share regular updates on the project's status, milestones achieved, and upcoming activities through various channels, such as the IPS website and public GitHub plan site.
2.  **Feedback loops**: Encourage open lines of communication, allowing stakeholders to provide input, ask questions, and voice concerns at any stage of the project.
3.  **Design previews**: Offer sneak peeks of the new websites' design, layout, and features, soliciting feedback and suggestions for improvements before the final launch.
4.  **Collaborative decision-making**: Involve key participants in major decisions related to design, content, and functionality, ensuring that the final product reflects the needs and priorities of the entire IPS community.

# Designing for Accessibility and Inclusivity

A key priority of the IPS website redesign is to ensure that the new websites are accessible and inclusive to all users, regardless of their abilities, background, or language preferences. By following accessibility guidelines and incorporating language support, we will create an online experience that truly serves our entire community.

## Following Accessibility Guidelines

To ensure the new IPS websites are accessible to users with disabilities, we will adhere to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1, aiming for AA compliance. This involves implementing various design and development best practices, such as:

1.  **Text alternatives**: Provide descriptive text alternatives for non-text content (e.g., images, charts) to aid users with visual impairments.
2.  **Keyboard navigation**: Ensure that the websites can be fully navigated using a keyboard, making them accessible to users with motor impairments or those who cannot use a mouse.
3.  **Consistent structure**: Maintain a consistent layout and navigation structure across the websites, making it easier for users with cognitive disabilities to understand and navigate the content.
4.  **Contrast and color**: Use sufficient color contrast and clear visual cues to improve readability and usability for users with low vision or color blindness.
5.  **Resizable text**: Enable users to adjust text size without loss of content or functionality, accommodating those with visual impairments.

## Creating an Inclusive Experience

Beyond basic accessibility, we will strive to create an inclusive online experience that caters to the diverse needs of our users. This may involve:

1.  **Culturally-responsive design**: Incorporate visual elements, images, and content that reflect the diverse backgrounds and identities of our students, staff, and community members.
2.  **Flexible content presentation**: Offer multiple ways to access and engage with content (e.g., text, audio, video) to accommodate diverse learning styles and preferences.
3.  **User customization**: Allow users to personalize their website experience, such as adjusting font size, color scheme, or content filtering, to better meet their individual needs.

## Language Support and Translations

To better serve our linguistically diverse community, the new IPS websites will include robust language support and translation options. Key strategies for implementing this support include:

1.  **Multilingual content**: Offer key content, such as important announcements and essential resources, in the most commonly spoken languages within the IPS community.
2.  **Translation tools**: Integrate website translation tools, such as Google Translate, to allow users to access content in their preferred language with a simple click.
3.  **Localized resources**: Provide information on language-specific resources and support services available within the district, such as ESL programs and translation assistance.

By prioritizing accessibility, inclusivity, and language support in the website redesign process, we will create an online experience that truly serves the diverse needs of the entire Indianapolis Public Schools community.

# Focus on User Experience and Interface Design

## Adopting a User-Centered Approach

A user-centered approach prioritizes the needs and preferences of the website users, ensuring a seamless and enjoyable experience. Most of this To adopt this approach, we will:

1.  Conduct user research: Gather insights from students, parents, teachers, and administrators to understand their needs, preferences, and pain points.
2.  Develop user personas: Create fictional representations of the target user groups to guide design decisions.
3.  Implement iterative design: Create and test multiple design prototypes, incorporating user feedback to refine the design and ensure it meets the needs of the target audience.

## Ensuring Easy Navigation and Usability

To provide a user-friendly experience, it is essential to ensure easy navigation and usability. We will:

1.  Create a clear and consistent navigation menu: Ensure that menu items are descriptive and logically organized to facilitate intuitive navigation.
2.  Implement breadcrumbs: Provide users with an easy way to track their progress and navigate back through the website.
3.  Design a search function: Enable users to quickly find information through keyword searches.

## Optimizing for Mobile Devices

As mobile usage continues to rise, it is essential to optimize the website for a seamless experience on smartphones and tablets. We will:

1.  Implement responsive design: Ensure that the website layout and design adapt to various screen sizes and devices.
2.  Optimize images and media: Compress images and multimedia content to reduce load times on mobile devices.
3.  Simplify navigation: Create mobile-friendly navigation menus and buttons for ease of use on smaller screens.

## Enhancing Page Load Times and Performance

Fast page load times are crucial for user satisfaction and engagement. To improve performance, we will:

1.  Optimize media files: Compress images, videos, and other media to reduce file sizes and improve load times.
2.  Implement caching: Utilize caching techniques to store frequently accessed content, reducing the need for repeated requests from the server.
3.  Minify code: Streamline HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code by removing unnecessary characters and whitespace.

## Designing Clear Calls-to-Action

Clear calls-to-action (CTAs) guide users towards desired actions and improve engagement. To create effective CTAs, we will:

1.  Use action-oriented language: Employ clear, concise, and persuasive language to encourage users to take action.
2.  Make CTAs visually prominent: Design CTAs that stand out from the surrounding content through size, color, and typography.
3.  Place CTAs strategically: Position CTAs in easily noticeable locations, such as above the fold or in logical places within the content flow.

By focusing on these aspects of user experience and interface design, we will create a website that is both visually appealing and user-friendly. The result will be a digital space that effectively serves the needs of the Indianapolis Public Schools community.

# Content Strategy and Development

## Content Inventory and Audit

Before we begin creating new content for the websites, it's essential to assess the existing content across all platforms. This process involves:

1.  Cataloging existing content: List all web pages, blog posts, downloadable resources, videos, images, and other content types present on the current websites.
2.  Evaluating content quality: Determine if the existing content is accurate, up-to-date, relevant, and aligned with the district's goals and objectives.
3.  Identifying content gaps: Analyze which topics or areas need additional content or updates to better serve the audience.

Based on the audit findings, the content team will create a content strategy that outlines what needs to be revised, removed, or created anew.

## Content Creation and Management

To ensure a consistent and cohesive content experience across all websites, the following steps will be taken:

1.  Establish a content style guide: Develop a set of guidelines that define the tone, voice, and style of writing, as well as formatting and visual consistency.
2.  Delegate content responsibilities: Assign specific content creation and editing tasks to the appropriate staff members or external contractors.
3.  Develop a content calendar: Outline the timeline for creating, editing, and publishing new content or updating existing content.
4.  Implement a content management system (CMS): Use a CMS that allows for easy collaboration, editing, and publishing of content across all websites.

## Visual and Multimedia Elements

Visual and multimedia elements play a crucial role in enhancing user engagement and conveying information effectively. The following steps will be taken to ensure high-quality visuals:

1.  Create a visual style guide: Establish a consistent visual identity across all websites, including color schemes, typography, images, and other design elements.
2.  Optimize images and videos: Ensure that all visual elements are optimized for fast loading and display correctly on various devices and screen sizes.
3.  Incorporate multimedia content: Utilize a mix of text, images, videos, infographics, and interactive elements to create an engaging user experience and cater to different learning styles.

## Plugins and Integrations

## Sending Messaging from Website
The website will be shifting away from SMTP authentication to send emails. As a result, it will be necessary to collaborate with the Information Technology department to whitelist emails originating from the website's IP address. This will enable the website to send crucial messages like reports, password resets, and other communications. Going forward, the website will be using WordPress's built-in email function to send emails.
## Content Managment System
WordPress is a versatile Content Management System (CMS) utilized by many due to its user-friendly interface and customization capabilities. Its popularity has led to the development of multisite features that allow users to manage multiple websites using a single installation of WordPress. IPS website employs WordPress as its CMS, providing users with an effortless way to create and publish content without needing extensive technical expertise.

## Information & Media Retention Strategy
As part of our efforts to reduce technical debt and streamline our website infrastructure, we will be implementing an Information & Media Retention Strategy. The purpose of this strategy is to ensure that only current and relevant content is stored on the website, reducing the amount of backend space required and improving website performance.

The following guidelines will be implemented as part of the Information & Media Retention Strategy:

* All media and content on the website will be reviewed annually to determine its relevance and usefulness. Any media or content that is no longer relevant will be removed from the website.

* Only media and content from the current school year and the previous school year will be stored on the website. All media and content from previous years will be removed, reducing the amount of backend space required.

* Site Editors will have the option to group and download their media at any time, ensuring that they can access their content within the retention timeframe, and store it in accordance with their own information archival strategies.

* In the event that a school is consolidated, its information and media will be migrated over following the previous and current school year pattern. This will ensure that important information is not lost during the consolidation process.

By implementing these guidelines, we aim to reduce technical debt, improve website performance, and ensure that only current and relevant information is stored on the website.

# Measuring Success with Analytics

To ensure the success of the website redesign project, it's crucial to measure its performance using analytics tools. This will provide valuable insights into user behavior, website traffic, and other key performance indicators (KPIs), allowing the project team to make data-driven decisions for future improvements.

## Setting up Analytics Tools

Before the website launch, we will set up and configure various analytics tools to monitor the website's performance. The primary tool will be Google Analytics, which provides comprehensive data on website traffic, user demographics, and user behavior. Additionally, we may utilize other tools, such as heat mapping and user session recording software, to gain further insights into how users interact with the site.

## Defining Key Performance Indicators

To measure the success of the website redesign, we will establish a set of key performance indicators (KPIs) that align with the project's objectives and goals. Some possible KPIs include:

*   Number of unique visitors
*   Bounce rate
*   Average session duration
*   Search engine rankings for target keywords
*   Page load times
*   Mobile and desktop user experiences

These KPIs will serve as benchmarks to evaluate the website's performance and identify areas that may require further optimization.

## Monitoring and Reporting on Progress

Regular monitoring of the website's performance is essential to ensure that the redesign project meets its objectives. The project team will establish a schedule for reviewing analytics data, tracking the website's KPIs, and evaluating the effectiveness of the redesign.

Monthly or quarterly reports will be generated, summarizing the website's performance and highlighting any areas that require attention. These reports will be shared with key stakeholders, including school administrators, to keep them informed of the website's progress and facilitate data-driven decision-making.

## Data-Driven Decision Making

Using the data gathered from analytics tools and KPI tracking, the project team will make informed decisions on how to improve the website further. This may include optimizing content, enhancing user experience, adjusting SEO strategies, or implementing new features based on user feedback.

By continually monitoring and analyzing the website's performance, we can ensure that the redesigned website meets the needs of all users, remains current with best practices, and achieves the objectives set forth at the beginning of the project.

Ongoing maintenance and support of the new website are critical to ensure that it continues to meet the needs of the target audience and remains up-to-date. This section focuses on keeping the website updated, responding to user feedback, and providing training and resources for staff.

## Keeping the Website Updated

Regular updates to the website are essential to ensure that the content remains accurate, relevant, and up-to-date. IPS should develop a content management plan to ensure that the website content is reviewed and updated regularly. The plan should include:

*   A feedback form on the website to collect user feedback
*   A system for responding to user feedback promptly
*   A process for reviewing and analyzing user feedback
*   A plan for incorporating user feedback into website improvements

IPS should also monitor social media and other online platforms to identify user feedback and respond appropriately.

## Providing Training and Resources for Staff

Training staff on how to use the website and the content management system (CMS) is crucial to ensure that the website remains up-to-date and meets the users' needs. IPS should develop a training plan for staff that includes:

*   A training schedule for all staff members involved in website maintenance and content management
*   Training materials, including user manuals and online tutorials
*   A process for updating training materials as necessary
*   A plan for providing ongoing support and resources to staff

By providing comprehensive training and resources, IPS can ensure that staff members are equipped to manage the website effectively and efficiently.

Overall, ongoing maintenance and support are critical to ensuring the website's success and meeting the users' needs. By keeping the website updated, responding to user feedback, and providing training and resources for staff, IPS can ensure that the website remains up-to-date and relevant, meets the users' needs, and achieves its objectives and goals.
