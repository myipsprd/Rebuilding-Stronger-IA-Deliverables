2.  **Enhance Accessibility and Inclusivity**: Ensure that the websites meet accessibility guidelines and provide an inclusive experience for all users, regardless of ability or language.
3.  **Streamline Content Strategy**: Develop a clear and consistent content strategy that effectively communicates important information and updates to stakeholders.
4.  **Optimize for Search Engines**: Increase the visibility of IPS websites in search engine results through the implementation of SEO best practices.
5.  **Measure Success with Analytics**: Utilize analytics tools to track website performance and make data-driven decisions for ongoing improvement.
6.  **Ensure Smooth Implementation and Launch**: Successfully complete the redesign project within the specified timeline and with minimal disruption to stakeholders.
7.  **Provide Ongoing Maintenance and Support**: Keep the websites updated and secure, while also offering training and resources for IPS staff.

### Aligning with IPS Vision and Values

The website redesign project will be guided by the core values and vision of Indianapolis Public Schools, ensuring that our online presence embodies the principles that define our district. These values include equity, engagement, collaboration, adaptability, and excellence.

By aligning the website redesign with these guiding principles, we aim to create a cohesive and authentic representation of IPS that fosters trust and pride among our stakeholders.

# Engaging Stakeholders

A successful website redesign requires the active engagement and input of a diverse group of stakeholders. By involving key participants in the process, we can ensure that the new websites effectively address the needs and priorities of our entire community.

## Identifying Key Participants

To ensure a comprehensive and inclusive approach to the redesign process, we will identify and engage key participants representing various stakeholder groups. These groups may include:

1.  **Parents and guardians**: Their input will provide valuable insights into the needs and expectations of those who utilize the websites to access important information about their children's education.
2.  **Students**: As primary users of the websites, students can offer unique perspectives on usability, design, and content that is relevant and engaging to their demographic.
3.  **Teachers and staff**: These stakeholders can provide input on the tools, resources, and information that will help them perform their jobs more effectively and support their students.
4.  **District leadership**: Their guidance will ensure that the redesign aligns with IPS' strategic vision and values, as well as district-wide goals and initiatives.
5.  **Community partners**: Local organizations, businesses, and community members can offer valuable input on how the websites can better serve the broader community.

## Ensuring Input from All Users

To gather feedback and input from our diverse stakeholders, we will use various methods, including:

1.  **Surveys and questionnaires**: Distribute online surveys to collect feedback on website features, design, and content priorities from all stakeholder groups.
2.  **Focus groups**: Conduct focus group discussions with representatives from key participant groups to delve deeper into their specific needs and preferences.
3.  **User testing**: Involve stakeholders in the testing process, allowing them to interact with the redesigned websites and provide feedback on their user experience.
4.  **Open forums**: Host public meetingsÂ 

    and online discussion sessions, inviting stakeholders to share their thoughts and ideas on the website redesign process.

## Keeping Everyone Informed and Involved

To maintain stakeholder engagement and build trust throughout the redesign process, we will implement a transparent and consistent communication strategy. This may include:

1.  **Progress updates**: Share regular updates on the project's status, milestones achieved, and upcoming activities through various channels, such as email newsletters, social media, and the IPS website.
2.  **Feedback loops**: Encourage open lines of communication, allowing stakeholders to provide input, ask questions, and voice concerns at any stage of the project.
3.  **Design previews**: Offer sneak peeks of the new websites' design, layout, and features, soliciting feedback and suggestions for improvements before the final launch.
4.  **Collaborative decision-making**: Involve key participants in major decisions related to design, content, and functionality, ensuring that the final product reflects the needs and priorities of the entire IPS community.

### Establishing a Stakeholder Engagement Team

To facilitate stakeholder engagement throughout the redesign process, we will establish a dedicated Stakeholder Engagement Team. This team will be responsible for coordinating all communication efforts, gathering and analyzing input from stakeholders, and ensuring that their feedback is effectively incorporated into the project.

By prioritizing stakeholder engagement, we can create a strong foundation for the successful redesign and launch of the new Indianapolis Public Schools websites, ensuring that they meet the diverse needs of our students, staff, and community members.

# Designing for Accessibility and Inclusivity

A key priority of the IPS website redesign is to ensure that the new websites are accessible and inclusive to all users, regardless of their abilities, background, or language preferences. By following accessibility guidelines and incorporating language support, we will create an online experience that truly serves our entire community.

## Following Accessibility Guidelines

To ensure the new IPS websites are accessible to users with disabilities, we will adhere to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1, aiming for AA compliance. This involves implementing various design and development best practices, such as:

1.  **Text alternatives**: Provide descriptive text alternatives for non-text content (e.g., images, charts) to aid users with visual impairments.
2.  **Keyboard navigation**: Ensure that the websites can be fully navigated using a keyboard, making them accessible to users with motor impairments or those who cannot use a mouse.
3.  **Consistent structure**: Maintain a consistent layout and navigation structure across the websites, making it easier for users with cognitive disabilities to understand and navigate the content.
4.  **Contrast and color**: Use sufficient color contrast and clear visual cues to improve readability and usability for users with low vision or color blindness.
5.  **Resizable text**: Enable users to adjust text size without loss of content or functionality, accommodating those with visual impairments.

## Creating an Inclusive Experience

Beyond basic accessibility, we will strive to create an inclusive online experience that caters to the diverse needs of our users. This may involve:

1.  **Culturally-responsive design**: Incorporate visual elements, images, and content that reflect the diverse backgrounds and identities of our students, staff, and community members.
2.  **Flexible content presentation**: Offer multiple ways to access and engage with content (e.g., text, audio, video) to accommodate diverse learning styles and preferences.
3.  **User customization**: Allow users to personalize their website experience, such as adjusting font size, color scheme, or content filtering, to better meet their individual needs.

## Language Support and Translations

To better serve our linguistically diverse community, the new IPS websites will include robust language support and translation options. Key strategies for implementing this support include:

1.  **Multilingual content**: Offer key content, such as important announcements and essential resources, in the most commonly spoken languages within the IPS community.
2.  **Translation tools**: Integrate website translation tools, such as Google Translate, to allow users to access content in their preferred language with a simple click.
3.  **Localized resources**: Provide information on language-specific resources and support services available within the district, such as ESL programs and translation assistance.

By prioritizing accessibility, inclusivity, and language support in the website redesign process, we will create an online experience that truly serves the diverse needs of the entire Indianapolis Public Schools community.

# Focus on User Experience and Interface Design
